      "Processing: The Samsung Galaxy S3 is probably the most wanted Android phone of the entire year 2012. Samsung has delivered So without any further ado, let's go ahead and take a look at the full review.\n",
      "Finished processing transcript 1 - batch 1.1\n",
      "Processing: So this is Samsung's flagship device worldwide so it deserves flagship worthy hardware And it gets exactly that on the inside of the United States version. We have a 1.5 gigahertz snapdragon S4 dual core PHONE_PERFORMANCE and a huge 2 gigs of PHONE_PERFORMANCE there's also 4g radio inside and it features expandable PHONE_PERFORMANCE via microsd all in a package that's just 8.6 millimeters thin And Samsung has done something awesome and made every carrier's version identical to each other So accessories will work on all of the Samsung Galaxy S3's in the world and you can even exchange the backs of them for a cool like white on blue contrast look if you like And to top off all the spec sheet stuff which is actually detailed here on the back of the boxes you get software wise Android 4.0.4 ice cream sandwich with the latest version of Samsung's touchwiz UX on top And we have some things to say about that too.\n",
      "Finished processing transcript 1 - batch 1.2\n",
      "Processing: The biggest new feature of them all literally is the new display it's a 4.8 inch HD super amoled display so 1280x720 an absolutely gorgeous display for a phone is it pentile yes but can you tell nope I mean this is a crystal clear super high contrast display with amazing responsiveness thanks to what's underneath a lot of people toss around the word pentile as if that means instant depth to a display but it's honestly you really can't tell unless you're looking at a much lower CAMERA of a pentile display first thing you notice when you're playing around with the galaxy s3 is what I like to call fluidity the smoothness of the user interface when you're flying around touchwiz it's literally unmatched by any other android phone i've been playing with the one X for a while the galaxy Nexus for a while but these animations here all execute at perfectly high frame rates And that's not something I can say for every other Android device and it just adds to that fluid experience. There's not a stutter anywhere And this is the one reason why if I had to pick an Android skin over pure Android it would be Touchwiz.\n",
      "Finished processing transcript 1 - batch 1.3\n",
      "Processing: I mean it's the fastest it's the lightest of them all Couple that with the two gigs of PHONE_PERFORMANCE in the Galaxy S3 and you're looking at a pretty freaking fast device. Touchwiz is also one of the least obtrusive in your face Android skins that there are So the user experience is pretty close to stock Android.\n",
      "Finished processing transcript 1 - batch 1.4\n",
      "Processing: There are a few minor changes like the settings menu and that notification battery percentage indicator. Another thing is they replace the stock calendar widget and app with their own Samsung themed one which is very different looking there are a few other pre--installed Samsung applications too, and depending on which carrier you go with in the United States, you'll get a few more pre--installed application.\n",
      "Finished processing transcript 1 - batch 1.5\n",
      "Processing: One thing that I actually found a little bit annoying is that the toggles in the notification area while they are really, really handy And I'm glad that they're there. The slide in animation that happens every time I pull down the notification tray.\n",
      "Finished processing transcript 1 - batch 1.6\n",
      "Processing: Like is that really necessary? Uh, the Wi--Fi toggle is all the way on the left and it slides in from the left So that prevents me from being able to immediately toggle Wi--Fi like right when I pull it down.\n",
      "Finished processing transcript 1 - batch 1.7\n",
      "Processing: So it's just a little bit annoying. Maybe just a minor complaint, I suppose.\n",
      "Finished processing transcript 1 - batch 1.8\n",
      "Processing: But something definitely worth mentioning the toggles themselves are pretty much all really useful And I'm really glad that they're part of touch was definitely one of my favorite features. Now that three button layout at the bottom some people love it, some people really hate it actually.\n",
      "Finished processing transcript 1 - batch 1.9\n",
      "Processing: some people don't like the home button that's physical at all. Honestly it really grew on me though actually after about five days of using the phone I kind of like it the the soft buttons disappear when they're not in use, you know they perform legacy functions but they aren't there when you don't need them.\n",
      "Finished processing transcript 1 - batch 2.0\n",
      "Processing: So that's pretty cool and you can access the PHONE_PERFORMANCE still by long pressing that home button. So honestly if you play with it and you don't like it at all give it some time you might actually find that you like it in the end.\n",
      "Finished processing transcript 1 - batch 2.1\n",
      "Processing: Overall there is a ton of Samsung stuff built in to the software touchwiz that I could never cover like smart stay and just keeps the phone on when you're looking at it in motion and all this stuff. But honestly, most of it is pretty gimmicky s voice, which is a freaking Siri clone of all things can be just as useless as Siri sometimes.\n",
      "Finished processing transcript 1 - batch 2.2\n",
      "Processing: Hi Galaxy, what is the capital of France didn't do anything. I like the lock screen though, which gives you the option to drag in apps to open them immediately.\n",
      "Finished processing transcript 1 - batch 2.3\n",
      "Processing: And it gives you the ability to pick which apps you have here, Nice touch. I always like the ability to open the CAMERA quickly.\n",
      "Finished processing transcript 1 - batch 2.4\n",
      "Processing: And speaking of CAMERA, the Galaxy S3 has an amazing CAMERA. It blows the Galaxy Nexus CAMERA out of the water and impressed me more than the one X's shooter.\n",
      "Finished processing transcript 1 - batch 2.5\n",
      "Processing: I like saying shooter, but it's an 8 CAMERA shooter on the back, it takes 1080p CAMERA, it has sharp autofocus. it performs well in CAMERA Which is great It takes stunning CAMERAs for a phone and is totally capable of replacing your point and shoot okay hear that you no longer need to bring another CAMERA on vacation or something you can literally just bring your phone I'm really happy.\n",
      "Finished processing transcript 1 - batch 2.6\n",
      "Processing: it's gotten to this level of quality the quality is great the CAMERAs and the features are plenty and it's fast. it's really really fast There's a burst mode which can take like 20 CAMERAs in a couple of seconds It's awesome very easy to use Also up front there's a 1.9 CAMERA front--facing CAMERA for stuff like Google plus hangouts and Skype and face unlock nice so is it a worthy flagship from Samsung It really is it's got the internals to support everything you throw at it from gaming to everyday use or to just heavy applications The battery life you get out of this is more than acceptable.\n",

      "Finished processing transcript 1 - batch 2.8\n",
      "Processing: The device itself is very thin. No need for a screen protector with that gorilla BUILD_QUALITY and the removable back gives you access to the internals the 2100 milliamp hour battery.\n",
      "Finished processing transcript 1 - batch 2.9\n",
      "Processing: the sim card, the SD card And this is some I never understand why people complain about the battery door being flexible because you should just put it back on the phone. I've never seen one break under normal use anything you throw at this, it can handle This phone is a boss.\n",

      "Processing: So to launch such an awesome device on pretty much every US carrier and then some that would be Verizon T-mobile, Sprint at T and U.S. Cellular, they held some pretty awesome launch occasions or parties or something like that launch events. And I went to the one that was in New York City.\n",
      "Finished processing transcript 1 - batch 3.2\n",
      "Processing: and I got a lot of awesome footage from that where they were talking about the device where they were launching it, where they were excited for it, it was kind of their own version of a keynote. They even poke fun at their competitors, like some other companies have been known to do one of our primary competitors, who likes to make a big deal of all the technology, they've embedded, their device has done a little more than launch a software upgrade.\n",
      "Finished processing transcript 1 - batch 3.3\n",
      "Processing: And that time we've launched free devices that most manufacturers would be licensing to stand on as well to be their primary devices. And that was actually the first time where I was able to see a US variant of the Galaxy S3.\n",
      "Finished processing transcript 1 - batch 3.4\n",

      "Finished processing transcript 1 - batch 3.5\n",
      "Processing: So it's pretty cool to see the Verizon version in person, even though it's actually technically not released yet. So there you go, The Galaxy S3 is obviously a really, really good device.\n",
      "Finished processing transcript 1 - batch 3.6\n",
      "Processing: It's very impressive device to me both on paper because the specs are awesome. It has two gigs of PHONE_PERFORMANCE, you know, the LTE for the Verizon and Sprint versions, everything like that.\n",
      "Finished processing transcript 1 - batch 3.7\n",
      "Processing: it's just a really great all--around device and then the experience on the other hand is also really good. And for me, it's actually enough to get me to switch from the Nexus to the Galaxy S3 on Verizon as my full--time Carry Daily device.\n",

      "Finished processing transcript 1 - batch 3.9\n",
      "Processing: But do you guys think that the Galaxy S3 is better than the other flagship devices out there? I can obviously compare it to the HTC one X if you like, because that's obviously another quad-core device overseas compared to the quad--core version of this.\n",
      "Finished processing transcript 1 - batch 4.0\n",

      "Processing: Hey, what is up guys? I'm Kay Phd here and the Samsung galaxy S4 will easily be one of the most popular phones of 2013 no doubt And when Samsung builds up that much hype for any phone like they do with the S4 Especially when the predecessor the S3 is so popular We kind of expect the S4 to be a really good phone and a lot of people see the galaxy S4 as an evolutionary update to the galaxy S3 And understandably So because of the naming but after my time with it I'm seeing it a bit differently.\n",
      "Finished processing transcript 2 - batch 2.1\n",
      "Processing: I'm seeing the galaxy S4 as more of a downsized reconstructed note to hear me out. So the galaxy S4 is more square than the galaxy S3 first of all And although it has very similar dimensions Samsung will tell you that it's slightly thinner and slightly lighter So that's true But you won't really notice these differences.\n",
      "Finished processing transcript 2 - batch 2.2\n",
      "Processing: If you're familiar with the galaxy S3 you also feel right at home with the button layout and the port layout because they're the same on the galaxy S4 And they're also the same as they are on the Galaxy Note 2. But overall the phone just looks and feels just different different in the way the Galaxy Note 2 feels different from the S3, mostly because this design, again, it's more square and then you check out the insides.\n",
      "Finished processing transcript 2 - batch 2.3\n",
      "Processing: You already know that you can take off the back, the thin, flexible plastic back of the Galaxy S4 to reveal the internals And that will reveal a removable 2600 milliamp hour battery and a micro SD card slot and the BUILD_QUALITY micro sim card, etc. Now compare this to the Galaxy S3 on the left and the Galaxy Note 2 on the right.\n",
      "Finished processing transcript 2 - batch 2.4\n",
      "Processing: And there is even more reason to consider the S4 A restructured note to the BUILD_QUALITY is now down in the bottom at the same place. The battery is also now lower in the chassis and the microsd card and micro sim card slots are now above the battery instead of below All these, Like the note 2, not the S3, Also on the Galaxy S3.\n",
      "Finished processing transcript 2 - batch 2.5\n",
      "Processing: The edges were so tapered that you had no real edge of the phone to grip. And that was a bit of a problem for me.\n",
      "Finished processing transcript 2 - batch 2.6\n",
      "Processing: But with the new S4 design, you actually have that metallic band around the phone That creates an edge to grip before the tapering starts. It's a small touch and it's something A lot of reviewers look past as a cheap attempt to look more premium, but it actually really changes the feel of the Galaxy S4 in the hand.\n",
      "Finished processing transcript 2 - batch 2.7\n",
      "Processing: you hold it? So on the hardware side of things, consider this guy a compacted Galaxy Note 2. that's just the way it feels in the hand.\n",
      "Finished processing transcript 2 - batch 2.8\n",
      "Processing: and the way it's built on the software side of things, though, this is familiar Samsung territory, so here on the galaxy S4 we have an updated touchwiz on top of Android 4.2 Jelly bean this time So first of all, since it's Android 4.2 now you get a bunch of new Google features like for example the quick settings in the notification bar that Samsung so generously colorized and added to they're accessible with a two finger swipe down from the top of the notification bar And you can basically customize them to let you one tap toggle any feature on the phone which is actually kind of nice. it's convenient and you also get Android 4.2 s lock screen widgets and the first one I install it as DashClock of course because it's beautiful but yeah, plenty of apps are supported.\n",
      "Finished processing transcript 2 - batch 2.9\n",
      "Processing: You can swipe to the right to open the CAMERA or swipe to add more lock screen widgets there. A welcome addition that the galaxy S3 and Note 2 don't have yet And then there's the rest of Touchwiz.\n",
      "Finished processing transcript 2 - batch 3.0\n",
      "Processing: So Samsung stuffed this phone to the gills with software features inside of Touchwiz. A lot of them will make for great commercials and gimmicky tricks and neat demos.\n",
      "Finished processing transcript 2 - batch 3.1\n",
      "Processing: So this one is very demo able which is very good for Samsung but in the end a lot of these features probably won't be used by the average user. So for example air view is new, it lets you hover your finger over an album in the gallery to get a preview of the CAMERAs inside.\n",
      "Finished processing transcript 2 - batch 3.2\n",
      "Processing: It's useful, it works but it's an extra gesture you have to learn and people are used to just tapping in an opening gallery anyway so I don't know if people will use that. There's also things like smart scroll and smart stay and smart pause and all this smart stuff that's supposed to basically read your eyes using a front-facing CAMERA and take action or adjust itself accordingly.\n",
      "Finished processing transcript 2 - batch 3.3\n",
      "Processing: They all work most of the time But if you have them on by accident, or you don't want them to be on, you may find your phone scrolling up and down or pausing CAMERAs or changing orientation by itself, when you didn't want or need it to do that. So I ended up turning these features off after a while they got annoying and I just didn't need them.\n",
      "Finished processing transcript 2 - batch 3.4\n",
      "Processing: And I did an explanation CAMERA of all these things. So I'll leave a link right below the like button on this CAMERA if you want an explanation of all the galaxy S4 software features.\n",
      "Finished processing transcript 2 - batch 3.5\n",
      "Processing: But basically, overall, TouchWiz has a lot of new added features that are, like I said, great for demos, it's great for showing off to your friends or something like that but eventually I turn them off because they just weren't doing it for me. I don't really need them overall though Touchwiz is still very colorful as we've seen on other devices and very very contrast II just like on the galaxy S3 and the note 2 and touch which is very contrasting because it's also on that m SCREEN_OR_DISPLAY display.\n",
      "Finished processing transcript 2 - batch 3.6\n",
      "Processing: And speaking of that display this is no ordinary amoled display, the galaxy S4 is rocking a 1920 by 1080 super amoled plus display. So that gives it a pixel density of 441 pixels per inch.\n",
      "Finished processing transcript 2 - batch 3.7\n",
      "Processing: And it does have a pentile sub pixel matrix But nobody can tell this display has far more pixels in that 5 inch space than any naked eye can decipher and that means razor sharp text CAMERAs, CAMERA, Everything I love it. it's what we've been waiting for it which what we knew was coming in the upgrade to the S4 and it is the number one reason to upgrade to this phone from something like the galaxy S3.\n",
      "Finished processing transcript 2 - batch 3.8\n",
      "Processing: Now because it's an amoled display, it also has a few advantages over other 1080P phones, for example in deeper blacks, higher contrast and lower power consumption but all of that comes with the trade--off that this display is no brighter than the galaxy S3 So it kind of struggles in daylight when compared to something like the HTC one. But that's of course another CAMERA.\n",
      "Finished processing transcript 2 - batch 3.9\n",
      "Processing: Now it's pushing these pixels with the Snapdragon 600 PHONE_PERFORMANCE in the United States which if you don't know is an absolute tank of a PHONE_PERFORMANCE, just a performance monster benchmark killer and all-around great chip. So it's going to score really high on pretty much any benchmark that you put it through And it's also going to get you great power consumption as well So I was able to get all-day battery life again about the same battery life as the Galaxy S3 with the stock battery I was using the Galaxy S3 on VErizon which was an LTE network and I was using the Galaxy S4 on AT&T which is now TE network And I was getting about the same battery life So despite the more powerful PHONE_PERFORMANCE and the bigger sharper display you're going to get about the same battery Which is pretty good for me all day Now you can't talk about that galaxy S4 without a little bit about that CAMERA And I gotta say it is an awesome one I'd say the best CAMERA on any smartphone i've ever used to date and that's including the latest iphone 5, the Galaxy Note 2, the Galaxy S3, the HTC one, the Lumia 920 This tops them all for me this is just an awesome all--around solid performing 13 CAMERA CAMERA for pretty much all types of situations.\n",
      "Finished processing transcript 2 - batch 4.0\n",
      "Processing: The CAMERA app of course is updated to the new version of Touchwiz. So it looks a lot like the interface on the Samsung Galaxy CAMERA Now and again it's filled with all these tons of gimmicky Touchwiz features that most people will never even know they have in their pocket but a few of them were actually kind of cool.\n",
      "Finished processing transcript 2 - batch 4.1\n",
      "Processing: So people like to get creative with their CAMERAs. You know, so for example I fell in love with the animated CAMERA feature that lets you take a few seconds of CAMERA clip and then basically animate just a part of it to form a jiff.\n",
      "Finished processing transcript 2 - batch 4.2\n",
      "Processing: And there are so many unique ways to use is it's not even funny I was walking around New York City all the time, just taking these. And the only real problem is sharing them because pretty much only Google+ supports GIFs that big, but it was very cool to use that feature.\n",
      "Finished processing transcript 2 - batch 4.3\n",
      "Processing: And I also take HDR's a lot. So it was good to see HDR make another appearance in this new version.\n",
      "Finished processing transcript 2 - batch 4.4\n",
      "Processing: No CAMERA spheres, Unfortunately kind of sucks since we're on Android 4.2 and everything. But yeah, I guess they can get away with omitting that.\n",
      "Finished processing transcript 2 - batch 4.5\n",
      "Processing: I'll include a full CAMERA panorama I took in New York in the description below. So you can see the real quality because Youtube won't really let me show you just how good-looking the CAMERAs this thing takes are.\n",
      "Finished processing transcript 2 - batch 4.6\n",
      "Processing: But trust me when I say they are beautifully sharp and detailed with all those pixels. And definitely good with the color department too.\n",
      "Finished processing transcript 2 - batch 4.7\n",
      "Processing: It's a solid performer in low--light as well. It's no Lumia 920 it's no HTC one and low-light, but it definitely produces acceptable CAMERAs and pretty much any lighting situation which lets me give it the crown of the best all--around CAMERA in a smartphone.\n",
      "Finished processing transcript 2 - batch 4.8\n",
      "Processing: So at the end of the day there are a lot of things to like about the Sonne from the 1080p display to the battery life to the note 2, like squarish design to the things like, you know the little touchwiz improvements on top of Android 4.2 Yet Then again there are plenty of things not to like, for example the settings app which took a huge step down and currently sucks with this lame tabbed interface that you can't even swipe through to get but it's really all about your values on when it comes to judging things like that and the huge question at the end of the day is, is it worth your upgrade? Is it worth your money to upgrade from the Galaxy S3 or from other phones?\n",
      "Finished processing transcript 2 - batch 4.9\n",
      "Processing: And right now, the verdict is if you have to have 1080P amoled, then yes, this is the way to go. This is the only way to go.\n",
      "Finished processing transcript 2 - batch 5.0\n",
      "Processing: If not, then you might be better off waiting. The software features you see here are basically around the corner.\n",
      "Finished processing transcript 2 - batch 5.1\n",
      "Processing: And a firmware update from the Galaxy S3 and the Galaxy Note 2 and other Samsung phones. But what about other phones like the HTC one or other 1080P devices?\n",
      "Finished processing transcript 2 - batch 5.2\n",
      "Processing: Well, there are some benefits to the Galaxy S4. For example, it's made of plastic, which is a PRO because that gives you a generally better signal strength.\n",
      "Finished processing transcript 2 - batch 5.3\n",
      "Processing: You get a lighter phone a little bit thinner, and you also get very fast GPS lock with a plastic back. But then again, there are cons like it being a fingerprint magnet and feeling cheap in the hand.\n",
      "Finished processing transcript 2 - batch 5.4\n",
      "Processing: So, overall, that decision comes down to what you prefer in a phone overall, though, I think this is a great phone. I'm definitely enjoying every second I spend with it.\n",
      "Finished processing transcript 2 - batch 5.5\n",
      "Processing: And maybe you will too. This is definitely worth checking out.\n",
      "Finished processing transcript 2 - batch 5.6\n",
      "Processing: I think I would go with the black version over the white version, though, just for the clean look, and less fingerprints. Either way.\n",
      "Finished processing transcript 2 - batch 5.7\n",
      "Processing: Thank you for watching. definitely subscribe and stay tuned for upcoming CAMERAs that relate to this one.\n",
      "Finished processing transcript 2 - batch 5.8\n",
      "Processing: very, very, very, very soon. And you're definitely going to want to see those.\n",
      "Finished processing transcript 2 - batch 5.9\n",
      "Processing: So I'll talk to you guys in the next CAMERA, Ace, you\n",
      "Finished processing transcript 2 - batch 6.0\n",
      "Processing: [MUSIC] Hey, what is up guys? MKBHD here?\n",
      "Finished processing transcript 3 - batch 3.1\n",
      "Processing: And this is the Samsung Galaxy S5. So right off the bat, we can see this phone looks really similar to the Galaxy S4 from last year.\n",
      "Finished processing transcript 3 - batch 3.2\n",
      "Processing: It has upgraded specs inside, of course, which are virtually identical to the one M8 except for one or two things. But it keeps a very similar design to the galaxy S4, though it is a little bit bigger.\n",
      "Finished processing transcript 3 - batch 3.3\n",
      "Processing: now to fit that 5.1 inch 1080p display and slightly bigger SCREEN_OR_DISPLAYs so awkwardly enough, One of the biggest complaints with the new design is about the backing, which a lot of people aren't a fan of. I mean, I called it, I call the gold version of this phone the band-aid edition.\n",
      "Finished processing transcript 3 - batch 3.4\n",
      "Processing: But basically it has all these little dimples across the back of this soft touch material. Turns out this is easier to grip and hold in the hand than the slippery metal of the HTC one M8.\n",
      "Finished processing transcript 3 - batch 3.5\n",
      "Processing: So while the M8 might be a little bit heavier and made entirely of metal, the S5 is easier to hold because it's lighter and the button placement is much better. You got the power button on the side now so you don't have to shimmy your hand and it has actual sides to grip, even though those sides are made of Samsung's fake metal.\n",
      "Finished processing transcript 3 - batch 3.6\n",
      "Processing: Oh, and the back happens to still be removable. So you get not only micro SD card expansion up to 128 extra gigabytes, but you also get access to that 2800 milliamp hour battery and something you might notice while taking that back off.\n",
      "Finished processing transcript 3 - batch 3.7\n",
      "Processing: Is this seal all the way around the inside of the cover of this phone? This is to make the internals or the whole phone IP67 certified.\n",
      "Finished processing transcript 3 - batch 3.8\n",
      "Processing: So IP67, the six means totally protected against dust and the seven means water resistant for limited periods of time, which is useful to some people. But you'll notice the seal does not go over the BUILD_QUALITY, which sounds alright.\n",
      "Finished processing transcript 3 - batch 3.9\n",
      "Processing: But it maxes out pretty low in volume compared to the HTC one. But, I guess, you know, everything is quiet compared to the one.\n",
      "Finished processing transcript 3 - batch 4.0\n",
      "Processing: So, the full CAMERA comparison between the S5 and the one are coming soon. But bottom line is, this thing is water-resistant and a lot of people are gonna like that, but also to protect the phone from dust and water, They needed to add probably my biggest gripe with the design of the entire phone.\n",
      "Finished processing transcript 3 - batch 4.1\n",
      "Processing: This freaking flap at the bottom that you have to pry off every time you want access to the USB port every time you want to charge it, that means you can'?t use any battery cases because you have to pry that thing out the way, All the time, it just gets in the way when you're plugged in and to top it all off, every time you unplug the phone from the wall, it reminds you to close the flap every single time, bottom line. I'm not a fan of the flap although I guess it is necessary to keep that certification.\n",
      "Finished processing transcript 3 - batch 4.2\n",
      "Processing: But other than that this is really a familiar design for anyone who's used previous Galaxy devices, especially the galaxy S4. And you'll notice they've changed the capacitive buttons up front.\n",
      "Finished processing transcript 3 - batch 4.3\n",
      "Processing: So now really the only face change besides the bigger SCREEN_OR_DISPLAYs is you have that PHONE_PERFORMANCE button and back button so you can hold down the PHONE_PERFORMANCE button to act as a mini button. And right between those capacitive buttons is the fingerprint CAMERA slash home button.\n",
      "Finished processing transcript 3 - batch 4.4\n",
      "Processing: I'm basically going to cover everything by saying it's not really that great. First of all it makes the home button a little bit mushier and less clicky than before And second of all much more importantly you have to swipe your finger perfectly vertically along the center of the pad for it to work.\n",
      "Finished processing transcript 3 - batch 4.5\n",
      "Processing: You don't just put your finger there, you have to swipe it perfectly vertically for it to work. So yes, you can register a bunch of fingerprints and secure your phone or your PayPal payments or whatever you want to do and it'll work if you take your time with it.\n",
      "Finished processing transcript 3 - batch 4.6\n",
      "Processing: But it's difficult to use correctly and it's not always accurate when you don't swipe your finger at just the right speed at the right angle which does by the way require holding the phone with one hand and swiping with the other. So you need two fingers to unlock your phone and sometimes i'd actually go to unlock my phone with the fingerprint on and it would work and then I'd unlock it a little bit later and it just wouldn't even work.\n",
      "Finished processing transcript 3 - batch 4.7\n",
      "Processing: It doesn't even ask, just lets me swipe to unlock and get in without my fingerprint uh and that was it so yeah, I turned off the fingerprint recognition stuff Before the end of the first day I used it really was a pain But anyway, once you unlock the phone and get in you are greeted with touchwiz on top of Android 4.4 And it's all right. it's definitely not my cup of tea.\n",
      "Finished processing transcript 3 - batch 4.8\n",
      "Processing: it's not my favorite, but I prefer it to previous versions. They definitely made some adjustments and cleaned it up and made changes that I like I know they've shaken that uh Inspired by nature stuff from Touchwiz on the Galaxy S3 But they still have these nature sound effects These bloop and noises that I've disabled had to disable them pretty much immediately for my own sanity.\n",
      "Finished processing transcript 3 - batch 4.9\n",
      "Processing: I wish they would clean up the sounds and actually I think that would have a surprisingly big effect on how you perceive the user interface but other than that thanks to the specs the S5 is pretty quick it's responsive There isn't really any lag in most places but when you do find lag like in the gallery for example it's bad like I mean for a high--end flagship phone with monster specs like this the phone really does have the slowest gallery so when you do find lag you'll notice it but Touchwiz is pretty much exactly as you'd expect colorful, big, bold and constantly pushing Samsung features one of those Samsung features being my magazine which is the pain that sits to the left of your home screens like Blinkfeed or Google Now and it's kind of this news aggregator like Blinkfeed and just talks to Flipboard basically pulls in some cool stories, very beautiful CAMERAry and uses the entire 5.1 inch display. Uh, I mean, it does what it's supposed to.\n",
      "Finished processing transcript 3 - batch 5.0\n",
      "Processing: it's just a matter of whether you want it there or not. Also it can't be disabled or hidden like Blinkfeed can.\n",
      "Finished processing transcript 3 - batch 5.1\n",
      "Processing: Now another notable thing here is the settings menu. Actually, I I thought it was in my galaxy S4 review that I mentioned that Samsung really needs to change the way they organize their settings basically because there were so many and they needed a search box.\n",
      "Finished processing transcript 3 - batch 5.2\n",
      "Processing: But this is absolutely not what I meant. I didn't mean, put them all in a grid of 60 something colorful icons that I have to scroll through to find what I want.\n",
      "Finished processing transcript 3 - batch 5.3\n",
      "Processing: Holy crap, there are just way too many for that. So I maintain Samsung should really find a better way to handle all of the device settings than this.\n",
      "Finished processing transcript 3 - batch 5.4\n",
      "Processing: There's a grid view. There's a list view.\n",
      "Finished processing transcript 3 - batch 5.5\n",

      "Finished processing transcript 3 - batch 5.6\n",

      "Finished processing transcript 3 - batch 5.7\n",
      "Processing: Obviously if you've used a galaxy S3 or you've used a galaxy S4 and you like it, This experience here will be very similar and there are other plenty of new useful features. The editable quick notification settings are really useful.\n",
      "Finished processing transcript 3 - batch 5.8\n",
      "Processing: There's also feature called toolbox that lets you store any five apps in this bubble that you can move around and it gives you quick access from that bubble to those apps anywhere. So no matter where you are, you just tap it and it brings up your favorite app list.\n",
      "Finished processing transcript 3 - batch 5.9\n",
      "Processing: It's nifty. I actually left that on and use it for a quite a bit.\n",
      "Finished processing transcript 3 - batch 6.0\n",
      "Processing: So these are the types of things that will get you to like the phone more and even if the things that you like aren't enabled by default, you'll probably find something buried in the settings somewhere that you can turn on and make it a much more enjoyable user experience. Now I mentioned at the beginning of the CAMERA that the galaxy S5 has basically identical specs to the one M8 except for a few key areas.\n",
      "Finished processing transcript 3 - batch 6.1\n",

      "Finished processing transcript 3 - batch 6.4\n",
      "Processing: Now maybe it's because I spent too much time with the four CAMERA CAMERA on the one M8. But basically the shots I'm taking, I'm noticing a few key characteristics again here one very very detailed tons of CAMERA and detail at 16 CAMERAs.\n",
      "Finished processing transcript 3 - batch 6.5\n",
      "Processing: And two they're very saturated CAMERAs and colorful in pretty much any conditions. So the CAMERA interface is pretty standard Samsung stuff, not you know, too overly simple.\n",
      "Finished processing transcript 3 - batch 6.6\n",
      "Processing: You know Samsung likes to give you a ton of options. There's lots of effects and things you can play with and change.\n",
      "Finished processing transcript 3 - batch 6.7\n",
      "Processing: You can take 4k CAMERA, you have software stabilization, you have HDR the whole deal, you have something here also called selective focus which again might ring a bell from the one M8. It's done a little bit differently here.\n",
      "Finished processing transcript 3 - batch 6.8\n",
      "Processing: Basically it instructs you to take a CAMERA of something close with an out of focus background and it takes a pair of CAMERAs for you. One that focuses on the foreground and one that focuses on the background, but lets you pick between them using just one button for near focus or far focus.\n",
      "Finished processing transcript 3 - batch 6.9\n",
      "Processing: But what I really liked was actually the pan-focus button, which actually lets you grab everything in focus at the same time, which can actually be really useful and let you get a whole shot, a whole composition, right through some software processing. So here we have another version, you can see near-focus, far focus, and then pan focus, Obviously, it's not perfect, and it's a pretty artificial effect.\n",
      "Finished processing transcript 3 - batch 7.0\n",
      "Processing: But the ability to switch the stuff on the fly on your phone with a single button press is pretty neat. I think a lot of people like that.\n",
      "Finished processing transcript 3 - batch 7.1\n",
      "Processing: So basically, I found myself taking a lot more CAMERAs with the galaxy S5, just because of how good the CAMERA looks, how good the CAMERAs look on the phone. So there's an awesome display combined with a 16 CAMERA shot and that really lets you grab detail from the smallest things and blow them up.\n",
      "Finished processing transcript 3 - batch 7.2\n",
      "Processing: The CAMERAs look really razor sharp. Now obviously if you CAMERA in a ton, you'll see smaller imperfections and blurs But this stuff you'll have trouble doing on pretty much any other smartphone CAMERA, 16 CAMERAs gives you a lot of room to play with.\n",
      "Finished processing transcript 3 - batch 7.3\n",
      "Processing: It's not 41, it's not 50, But you guys know I love pixels and it's awesome to see this much detail and color in a quick shot like this. And the ability to shoot 4k CAMERA is a sweet bonus.\n",
      "Finished processing transcript 3 - batch 7.4\n",
      "Processing: So nice job on the CAMERA. Samsung, but hold up a minute, what is below the CAMERA?\n",
      "Finished processing transcript 3 - batch 7.5\n",
      "Processing: What is going on there? That is not an extra depth CAMERA or anything fancy for imaging, that is actually a heart rate monitor.\n",
      "Finished processing transcript 3 - batch 7.6\n",
      "Processing: Yeah, a special hardware to measure your heart rate obviously s health is still a thing that Samsung does So they've plugged into that CAMERA on the back of the phone and essentially if you hold your finger there for a few seconds it'll give you a reading of your heart rate in beats per minute Now I don't actually know how accurate this is because I don't have another heart rate CAMERA to control but it's a neat feature. It's a neat demo to bolster the S health.\n",
      "Finished processing transcript 3 - batch 7.7\n",
      "Processing: uh, portfolio of things it can do it's a pedometer and hurry monitor, whatever it's s health so anyway Yeah, if you're not getting the CAMERA by now basically the galaxy S5 is an improvement in a lot of ways over the galaxy S4 Uh and a lot of smartphone enthusiasts tend to see that as I guess a bad thing because they really didn't like the galaxy S4 or they were expecting a bigger change but for the many millions of people who will inevitably buy this phone that's actually great The Galaxy S4 was a solid phone and this phone improves on it in a lot of important ways So so what if this phone looks like a band--aid in gold Get it in black or Get it in white Get it in blue. You know it's great it's a high--end phone with a ton of features it's water-resistant It has an excellent battery life that nobody should have any problems with it has a beautiful large colorful bright display Easily the best amoled display in the business on a smartphone right now.\n",
      "Finished processing transcript 3 - batch 7.8\n",
      "Processing: It's lightweight it's made of some cheap materials Sure, but you're coming from the S4 so you're probably not going to notice and really the only real downside I have with TouchWiz is or with the galaxy S5 is Touchwiz and it's quirks and I guess the BUILD_QUALITY a little bit too. But Touchwiz will continue to evolve And right now the galaxy S5 really is the galaxy S4 S that I called it in my first impressions CAMERA.\n",
      "Finished processing transcript 3 - batch 7.9\n",
      "Processing: So don't mind me, I'm just going to sit back over here and quietly cross my fingers waiting for a Google Play edition of this phone because the new Google CAMERA came out today and it's great and I like stock Android and I feel like I would really enjoy a Google Play edition galaxy S5 But in the meantime, there it is, this is the Samsung galaxy S5.

      "Processing: Hey, what is up guys MKBHD here? And this is the full review of the Samsung Galaxy S7.\n",
      "Finished processing transcript 5 - batch 5.1\n",
      "Processing: So this is a phone that's similar in a lot of ways to its predecessor, the one that came before it, which would be the galaxy S6. So the easiest way to talk about this phone And to completely understand it is to look at all the differences between it and the one that came before it.\n",
      "Finished processing transcript 5 - batch 5.2\n",
      "Processing: So this is everything you need to know. that's new and different about the Galaxy S7.\n",
      "Finished processing transcript 5 - batch 5.3\n",
      "Processing: So first of all, the body is slightly different. It's slightly upgraded.\n",
      "Finished processing transcript 5 - batch 5.4\n",
      "Processing: And most people hear that to me and it got thinner. But this phone is actually slightly thicker.\n",
      "Finished processing transcript 5 - batch 5.5\n",
      "Processing: And I'm calling that the upgrade because it's allowing one, a much smaller CAMERA bump on the back and two, a much smaller home button slash fingerprint reader bump on the front actually had a lot less accidental home button presses with this phone. So that's nice And the phone is still pretty thin, But the extra space inside is packing a much larger 3000 milliamp hour battery.\n",
      "Finished processing transcript 5 - batch 5.6\n",
      "Processing: So that's pretty important. And then they focused on the shape and the handle a little bit more, so the edges are less sharp.\n",
      "Finished processing transcript 5 - batch 5.7\n",
      "Processing: The phone is easier to pick up and hold, and the back BUILD_QUALITY is more rounded on the sides, like the Galaxy Note 5. And then the rest is all the same premium materials from last year.\n",
      "Finished processing transcript 5 - batch 5.8\n",
      "Processing: So gorilla BUILD_QUALITY, 4 on the front and back, and then metal rails on the sides and really nice buttons. I don't think Samsung gets enough credit for how nice the buttons are.\n",
      "Finished processing transcript 5 - batch 5.9\n",
      "Processing: They pretty much have the power button and volume buttons on point. So overall, you get the idea that the build is slightly improved, but still very familiar.\n",
      "Finished processing transcript 5 - batch 6.0\n",
      "Processing: In fact, this is definitely still the slipperiest phone I've ever held or used alongside the note 5. Like this has slipped out of my pocket while sitting in a car multiple times.\n",
      "Finished processing transcript 5 - batch 6.1\n",
      "Processing: But yeah, overall, the shape. And build of this phone is definitely one of those incremental improvements from last year.\n",
      "Finished processing transcript 5 - batch 6.2\n",
      "Processing: Okay, the next difference is IP68. This phone is now totally dust sealed and water resistant So you can use it in the rain or near a pool or at a beach or get splashed or whatever, it's fine.\n",
      "Finished processing transcript 5 - batch 6.3\n",
      "Processing: And it does it all internally. So there's no like weird flaps or anything over the USB ports or the headphone jack.\n",
      "Finished processing transcript 5 - batch 6.4\n",
      "Processing: I love that The design stays the hit as it gets waterproof here. The one downside is definitely the BUILD_QUALITYs.\n",
      "Finished processing transcript 5 - batch 6.5\n",
      "Processing: The BUILD_QUALITYs suffer massively here. Pretty sure the Galaxy S7 just got the biggest downgrade of any BUILD_QUALITYs on a smartphone.\n",
      "Finished processing transcript 5 - batch 6.6\n",
      "Processing: They're now way, tinier and more distorted sounding. And you can blame that fully on the waterproofing.\n",
      "Finished processing transcript 5 - batch 6.7\n",
      "Processing: So the Galaxy S7 also got the micro SD card slot back. I did not expect that to actually happen.\n",
      "Finished processing transcript 5 - batch 6.8\n",
      "Processing: I threw that out there in an older like predictions CAMERA as a sort of a oddball feature that might happen but you do actually have it now you do have expandable PHONE_PERFORMANCE in the Galaxy S7 and of course you can't have a new flagship phone without all your new flagship specs and you get all of that here. So in the US that's the Snapdragon 820 chip adreno 430 and 4 gigabytes of PHONE_PERFORMANCE and performance is definitely up to snuff to match This is a really quick and snappy phone again like the Galaxy S6 was and we're getting much improved PHONE_PERFORMANCE management as well.\n",
      "Finished processing transcript 5 - batch 6.9\n",
      "Processing: that's big here, I'm glad to see this phone handle PHONE_PERFORMANCE that much better than its predecessor, which kind of occasionally had issues holding apps and PHONE_PERFORMANCE with metal and BUILD_QUALITY. It still does get a bit warm even with the new internal cooling but nothing too severe.\n",
      "Finished processing transcript 5 - batch 7.0\n",
      "Processing: Just a little warm to the touch. when you're gaming for a while or doing some heavy browsing but just with everyday use it's fine BATTERY_OR_CHARGING heats up a bit but I'll talk about that later.\n",
      "Finished processing transcript 5 - batch 7.1\n",
      "Processing: So yeah, this phone is fast again that's one of its biggest strengths and definitely one of the biggest reasons to get it. So the last but not least actually the biggest difference with the new S7 is the new CAMERA, this new 12 CAMERA CAMERA.\n",
      "Finished processing transcript 5 - batch 7.2\n",
      "Processing: This is my favorite CAMERA on any smartphone right now And that's putting it on top of a very good heap of other smartphone, CAMERAs out there. And I gotta say there's no shooter that consistently makes me feel as confident as a CAMERA and CAMERA taker as the Galaxy S7.\n",
      "Finished processing transcript 5 - batch 7.3\n",
      "Processing: And that's what really makes a good CAMERA experience for me so the CAMERA app opens with that double tap of the home button really quick from anywhere again super fast and it's immediately ready for a shot. there's no CAMERA lag or anything It's very quick to just grab a CAMERA and a lot of people look at the new 12 CAMERA CAMERA number and think oh wait that's less CAMERAs than last year.\n",
      "Finished processing transcript 5 - batch 7.4\n",
      "Processing: it's not a big deal 12 CAMERAs is still plenty and these pixels are now larger which along with the CAMERA CAMERA stabilization and the huge F 1.7 aperture should help a lot with CAMERA should uh, the CAMERA quality in auto mode is again very typical Samsung so very bright punchy colors lots of saturation and contrast and sharpening. they've been doing this forever so I get it one thing that's more notable is that F 1.7 aperture makes it so easy to blow backgrounds out of focus uh, even in broad daylight with normal subjects, if you get close enough to the subject, you can get that blurry background which is pretty crazy.\n",
      "Finished processing transcript 5 - batch 7.5\n",
      "Processing: And the new dual pixel autofocus handles this shallow depth of field really well. Pretty much always nails it.\n",
      "Finished processing transcript 5 - batch 7.6\n",
      "Processing: So CAMERAs pretty much always look solid coming off this phone. I'd say the biggest weakness is it tends to over expose a bit in daylight conditions.\n",
      "Finished processing transcript 5 - batch 7.7\n",
      "Processing: There are definitely more blown highlights than crushed shadows. Although throughout the CAMERAs I've taken, it's actually not the best in CAMERA Here's an example of the exact same CAMERA I took on the galaxy S7 versus my Nexus 6p.\n",
      "Finished processing transcript 5 - batch 7.8\n",
      "Processing: Now nexuses haven't even always had the best CAMERA processing but it clearly beats the S7 here. So I would have liked to have seen, I guess less grain from the S7 CAMERA and CAMERA and a little bit more control exposure during the day.\n",
      "Finished processing transcript 5 - batch 7.9\n",
      "Processing: Here's the thing though that auto focus is the best part of this new CAMERA and it's crazy fast. also in CAMERA mode, it's just as fast making this pretty much the ideal for high quality CAMERA if you want to shoot 4k CAMERA in the easiest possible way, guarantee usable footage.\n",
      "Finished processing transcript 5 - batch 8.0\n",
      "Processing: This phone is the one to have overall the fast autofocus combined with the fast aperture and the fast CAMERA app make this the fastest smartphone CAMERA alongside the iphone. And it's a pleasure to use for that reason.\n",
      "Finished processing transcript 5 - batch 8.1\n",
      "Processing: Oh and that front facing CAMERA is not bad. Also 5 CAMERAs and also an F 1.7 aperture and an even wider angle than the back CAMERA.\n",
      "Finished processing transcript 5 - batch 8.2\n",
      "Processing: It's not quite as sharpened or oversaturated, but it takes a pretty good selfie. if you're into that.\n",
      "Finished processing transcript 5 - batch 8.3\n",
      "Processing: So there you have it a couple of incremental but important changes that make the Galaxy S7 a different beast Plus I guess all the things about the galaxy S6 that were already pretty great. The best display in any smartphone.\n",
      "Finished processing transcript 5 - batch 8.4\n",
      "Processing: The 5.1 inch quad HD, super amoled that gets super bright. The premium materials, the fast home button fingerprint reader.\n",
      "Finished processing transcript 5 - batch 8.5\n",
      "Processing: that's I think, second only to touch ID and some quick charging and BATTERY_OR_CHARGING of a new larger battery. And the actual life for me with a larger battery was really impressive too.\n",
      "Finished processing transcript 5 - batch 8.6\n",
      "Processing: I would give myself like a B plus or a minus For as far as how long this lasts during the day, pretty much never have to charge it before the end of the day. And I was getting somewhere between five to five and a half hours of BATTERY_OR_CHARGING typically, which is a big improvement over the notably bad battery life of the galaxy S6.\n",
      "Finished processing transcript 5 - batch 8.7\n",
      "Processing: So that's something I was really excited to see. And you also still have fast charging.\n",
      "Finished processing transcript 5 - batch 8.8\n",
      "Processing: You still have BATTERY_OR_CHARGING. You still have fast BATTERY_OR_CHARGING.\n",
      "Finished processing transcript 5 - batch 8.9\n",
      "Processing: It does get a little bit warm to the touch when you're BATTERY_OR_CHARGING. But other than that pretty much no complaints about the new battery.\n",
      "Finished processing transcript 5 - batch 9.0\n",
      "Processing: Now it's definitely not perfect. It still has its flaws.\n",
      "Finished processing transcript 5 - batch 9.1\n",
      "Processing: I made an entire CAMERA about that and if you want to watch that, it'll be linked in this corner or below that like button. And it's missing a couple things.\n",
      "Finished processing transcript 5 - batch 9.2\n",
      "Processing: You know, it doesn't have an IR blaster. Some people were confused about the dropping of that.\n",
      "Finished processing transcript 5 - batch 9.3\n",
      "Processing: It's also, like I mentioned the slipperiest phone ever and definitely looks and feels better with a case or even better. A nice skin on it.\n",
      "Finished processing transcript 5 - batch 9.4\n",
      "Processing: Plus you kind of hide the fingerprints and make it easier to hold. I'll link the DBRAND skin below.\n",
      "Finished processing transcript 5 - batch 9.5\n",
      "Processing: I think that matte looks clean and it's definitely still not everyone's favorite software. So this Samsung skin on top of Android obviously since it's Android you can still go to town with the skins and custom launchers and really make it your own.\n",
      "Finished processing transcript 5 - batch 9.6\n",
      "Processing: But someone like me will do that within minutes of setting it up. Someone who's not really into it.\n",
      "Finished processing transcript 5 - batch 9.7\n",
      "Processing: might take a while and might not like it out the box. But overall I really like this phone.\n",
      "Finished processing transcript 5 - batch 9.8\n",
      "Processing: Some of the little stuff that used to be third-party apps Samsung is picking up on it and building it into their own software. So stuff like the always-on display is a nice touch.\n",
      "Finished processing transcript 5 - batch 9.9\n",
      "Processing: So for example since it's always an amoled display you can choose to always have a clock calendar or still CAMERA when the phone is sleeping and it avoids burn in by moving around. The display periodically doesn't burn too much battery.\n",
      "Finished processing transcript 5 - batch 10.0\n",
      "Processing: I think it's cool if you use the calendar a lot It would be cool to have that always on. I'm not sure why you'd want a still CAMERA but hey there's always that option.\n",
      "Finished processing transcript 5 - batch 10.1\n",
      "Processing: but yeah it's taking a lot of stuff like this and adding it into their own software. So if you don't find it on day one then you'll probably find it a little while down the road after using this phone for a while.\n",
      "Finished processing transcript 5 - batch 10.2\n",
      "Processing: But at the end of the day the big question is is this Galaxy S7 worth the upgrade over whatever phone you have. Now if you have something like a Galaxy S6 or even a high--end phone from last year, it might not be worth all the changes, the couple of things you do get, if you're really, really into CAMERA, this is the best CAMERA CAMERA on a smartphone now.\n",
      "Finished processing transcript 5 - batch 10.3\n",
      "Processing: And if you're really into having a better battery life, this is definitely a better battery life than the galaxy S6. But if you're gonna upgrade if you have to, and you're not really sure, I would at least opt for the galaxy S7 edge, which is a little bit bigger, but you also get those edge features and you get an even larger battery for even better battery life.\n",
      "Finished processing transcript 5 - batch 10.4\n",
      "Processing: overall. A pretty well-rounded experience.\n",
      "Finished processing transcript 5 - batch 10.5\n",
      "Processing: No pun intended. That was totally intended.\n",
      "Finished processing transcript 5 - batch 10.6\n",

      "Finished processing transcript 5 - batch 10.7\n",

      "Processing: Foreign [MUSIC] Hey, what is up guys? MKBHD here?\n",
      "Finished processing transcript 6 - batch 6.1\n",
      "Processing: And a couple years ago in 2014, Samsung made a surprise product announcement called the Galaxy Note edge with this crazy display hanging off one side and for a random unexpected phone, it got a lot of attention. Since then that product has evolved again and again into Samsung's entire flagship lineup, which brings us to the galaxy S8.\n",
      "Finished processing transcript 6 - batch 6.2\n",
      "Processing: So this new phone looks awesome And that's its hallmark headlining feature is how good it looks and how well it's designed. And then of course, being a flagship, it has all the bleeding edge specs inside and the hardware you'd expect from a premium Android phone.\n",
      "Finished processing transcript 6 - batch 6.3\n",
      "Processing: So is this the complete package like the ultimate smartphone? Almost it's almost it's almost there.\n",
      "Finished processing transcript 6 - batch 6.4\n",
      "Processing: So let me start by saying I love this phone's build, like pretty much everything about the outside of this phone is premium and well built and awesome. The display up front sort of melts over both sides.\n",
      "Finished processing transcript 6 - batch 6.5\n",
      "Processing: And it does so smoothly into the back frame. While last year's phone did it more sharply.\n",
      "Finished processing transcript 6 - batch 6.6\n",
      "Processing: And if you want to talk about modern or about the future of smartphone design, this year has been a shift to these really tall displays, making these slightly taller candy bar shaped phones. Now, the best part of these super thin SCREEN_OR_DISPLAYs on all sides is that the footprint of the phone shrinks a lot.\n",
      "Finished processing transcript 6 - batch 6.7\n",
      "Processing: So the 5.8 inch and 6.2 inch displays respectively on the S8 and S8 plus, don't feel like huge phones, even though they have huge screens. In fact, the S8, I think, is a great size because it's so narrow.\n",
      "Finished processing transcript 6 - batch 6.8\n",
      "Processing: I might have big hands, but I think even anyone with regular hands can reach across to the other side of this display, just maybe not all the way up to the top. And I think the best indicator for this is the fingerprint CAMERA.\n",
      "Finished processing transcript 6 - batch 6.9\n",
      "Processing: Obviously, there's no more room to put it up at the front of the phone. So they moved it around to the back But instead of putting it somewhere in the middle of the back, they put it right up there next to the CAMERA.\n",
      "Finished processing transcript 6 - batch 7.0\n",
      "Processing: Now with most back fingerprint CAMERAs, they're a little lower on the phone for reachability. Just the way you hold the phone makes it easier.\n",
      "Finished processing transcript 6 - batch 7.1\n",
      "Processing: Now, I think the top fingerprint CAMERA might look a little bit better in some cases, but it is definitely harder to reach even with my larger hands. I legit dislike this location.\n",
      "Finished processing transcript 6 - batch 7.2\n",
      "Processing: I hold the phone with my right hand. So I'm reaching the maximum distance up and over across the phone, over across the CAMERA with my finger.\n",
      "Finished processing transcript 6 - batch 7.3\n",
      "Processing: And often I don't quite make it or I touch the CAMERA BUILD_QUALITY instead, or I only partially cover the fingerprint CAMERA and the reader doesn't unlock. It doesn't work.\n",
      "Finished processing transcript 6 - batch 7.4\n",
      "Processing: So this is through a week of using the phone. I'm sure i could get used to it eventually.\n",
      "Finished processing transcript 6 - batch 7.5\n",
      "Processing: But for most people this just makes it a two-handed phone. And then you can end up just using the phone with two hands all the time.\n",
      "Finished processing transcript 6 - batch 7.6\n",
      "Processing: Now to be fair, the BUILD_QUALITY over the CAMERA actually does a good job deflecting smudges that come from errant fingerprint unlocks But honestly, a clever way to get past this is with a case or better yet a skin actually. So this is the skin from DBRAND.\n",
      "Finished processing transcript 6 - batch 7.7\n",
      "Processing: And not only is it better for gripping this all BUILD_QUALITY phone, but the tiny depth difference actually lets you better distinguish the fingerprint CAMERA from the CAMERA on the back. So fun fact, highly recommended.\n",
      "Finished processing transcript 6 - batch 7.8\n",
      "Processing: Either way, Samsung's word on this is now they provide you with a bunch of other ways to unlock your phone biometrically that don't use a fingerprint CAMERA, mainly being the iris scanner. and the face unlock.\n",
      "Finished processing transcript 6 - batch 7.9\n",
      "Processing: Now, I didn't expect to like this answer, mainly because the face unlock can literally be tricked with a CAMERA of you. So that's no good.\n",
      "Finished processing transcript 6 - batch 8.0\n",
      "Processing: And the iris scanner usually requires you holding it up at a weird angle that you don't normally hold your phone, which is a little awkward. But this iris scanner, I think it might have a wider angle CAMERA or the CAMERA has improved.\n",
      "Finished processing transcript 6 - batch 8.1\n",
      "Processing: Something about it is better because I don't quite have to hold it up at that awkward angle anymore. And it does a pretty good job of unlocking my phone When I'm not like trying to.\n",
      "Finished processing transcript 6 - batch 8.2\n",
      "Processing: I set it up. I didn't expect to use it, but a lot of times I just hold the phone up and start using it and it would unlock for me.\n",
      "Finished processing transcript 6 - batch 8.3\n",
      "Processing: So that actually turned out to be a pleasant surprise. either way, Aside from the awkward tallness of the phone and the fingerprint CAMERA, the galaxy S8 is the best industrial design of any smartphone in a long time, in my opinion.\n",

      "Processing: Even though there are other phones out now and come coming soon, that do the tall display thin SCREEN_OR_DISPLAYs thing, you still got to add on all metal and BUILD_QUALITY still has expandable PHONE_PERFORMANCE through a micro SD card slot. Still fully water and dust-resistant IP68 certified.\n",

It might be the worst part of the phone's build, but that comes with the territory When there's no room on the front and you kind of want to water, seal your phone So back to the screen.\n",

      "Processing: We're talking 2960 by 1440 on both phones actually. So all that makes for an awesome media experience, a great web browsing experience and great scrolling through Twitter and Instagram and seeing a lot of stuff at once Experience and all of Samsung's software, obviously, he supports it perfectly.\n",

      "Processing: it's give a little take a little for the slightly taller display but overall I'll take it I think the screen is awesome and with its curved edges and curved corners i'm a fan and then there is the inside of the phone. And since this is a flagship Samsung is again pushing things to the highest end of what's available except for one particular area But there's some pretty high-end specs in here.\n",

      "Processing: Snapdragon 835 Adreno 540 PHONE_PERFORMANCE four gigabytes of PHONE_PERFORMANCE at least 64 gigs of PHONE_PERFORMANCE which like we said is expandable And this is the first phone to ship with Bluetooth 5.0 which I made an entire separate CAMERA about that just dropped highly recommend that so the performance aspect is pretty much taken care of the same way it always is great specs great speed and animations out the box But nobody has used this phone for a year or two yet so we'll have to see how the Samsung software ages and that's just what it is it's Samsung software on top of Android 7.0 and it has its pros and cons I actually like that it's adapted to be more like nougat with the swiping app drawer and the cleaner overall look especially of the settings app But it's really obviously still Samsung eyes with all the colors and some interesting quirks here and there with the paginated app drawer and the couple extra animations Nothing too crazy or extra but it's not necessarily better than not having it, the edge screen has gotten better. There's now a couple features like from the note with Smart select and the GIF maker where you can select part of your screen to make an animation or even take round screenshots all kinds of stuff that we didn't have before.\n",
      "Finished processing transcript 6 - batch 9.6\n",

      "Finished processing transcript 6 - batch 9.7\n",
      "Processing: So i'm really glad that made its way back into this phone. But yeah, overall, it's familiar to anyone who's used a Samsung phone in the last two or three years, both aesthetically and functionally.\n",
      "Finished processing transcript 6 - batch 9.8\n",
      "Processing: Now, one of the biggest new features in the software department of the galaxy S8, is called Bixby. You may have heard of it.\n",
      "Finished processing transcript 6 - batch 9.9\n",
      "Processing: it's the virtual assistant that's built for this phone that just does a lot of what Google Assistant does Now the circumstances surrounding it are interesting because Samsung put a dedicated button on the side of the phone just for launching it a Bixby button Now a lot of people didn't like this for fair reason whether they didn't like Bixby or didn't want it So they found a way to use an app to remap the Bixby button to do whatever they want Probably should have been in the Samsung settings in the first place You can make it the default for the button sure but in in regions where people don't use Bixby or Bixby is not supported or language supports not there yet or it's incomplete Let them go on the settings and remap it to whatever they want It could be a legitimate useful separate feature Well yesterday Samsung actually patched that up and blocked any remapping of that button at all on the galaxy S8 So it's definitely now just a bixby so understandably again people got kind of angry about that nobody wants accidental triggers of the app they want to never use But a couple of people were asking well hey what if what if Bixby is actually really great What if Bixby is amazing What if it's better than Google So I gave it that chance I didn't remap my Bixby button and I was using Bixby alongside this phone for the past week and I'll give you that so first of all the voice feature is not activated yet and it won't get added till later this year. So that's a pretty rough start but aside from that it does show you some cards your gallery, your upcoming calendar events maybe some weather, some frequent contacts.\n",
      "Finished processing transcript 6 - batch 10.0\n",
      "Processing: But then that pretty quickly devolved into a bunch of Samsung apps like themes and wallpapers and flipboard and a bunch of stuff I don't use. So really it's working in catch--up mode to be able to do all that Google does with Gmail and navigation cards and flight status and all that.\n",
      "Finished processing transcript 6 - batch 10.1\n",
      "Processing: Now the one place it did do some interesting stuff is in the CAMERA app in the viewfinder. There's a Bixby button that if you press it it can recognize CAMERAs in the viewfinder and search for them whether it's CAMERAs or if it's a product it will get you Amazon search to maybe buy it.\n",
      "Finished processing transcript 6 - batch 10.2\n",
      "Processing: I've seen Google Goggles try this a couple years ago and with Bixby it was about the same pretty hit or miss. Sometimes it would get it and it would be pretty useful especially when there's a lot of text to it that I can recognize it just searches that text so it makes sense that it would work there.\n",
      "Finished processing transcript 6 - batch 10.3\n",
      "Processing: Other times when I thought it might get it, nothing came up or it got it wrong with this Bluetooth BUILD_QUALITY for example sometimes it got nothing. Sometimes it thought it was a baseball hat.\n",
      "Finished processing transcript 6 - batch 10.4\n",
      "Processing: I don't know, Not sure how to get it to work better, but no dice. So aside from this biggest new software feature being kind of a swing and a miss on this phone I'm totally fine with the software on the S8, it's cleaner.\n",

      "Processing: It's a 12 CAMERA F 1.7 aperture dual pixel autofocus CAMERA CAMERA stabilization top-notch stuff again but yeah same as we've already seen but turns out this is a slay highly updated CAMERA with newer optics So the CAMERAs will look slightly different from the galaxy S7, Honestly, most of the difference will come from better CAMERA processing but the CAMERAs and 4k CAMERAs from galaxy S8 look fantastic as you would expect. Maybe leave a comment if you want a direct comparison to its predecessor but you can imagine you can see the sample is great detail, great contrast, color and sharpness are excellent and pretty aggressive auto HDR modes.\n",
      "Finished processing transcript 6 - batch 10.9\n",
      "Processing: So dynamic range is also pretty wide, rarely blows out the highlights like a lot of other phones would. So, of course, it's a pleasure to take CAMERAs and CAMERAs with such a nice screen as a viewfinder.\n",

      "Finished processing transcript 7 - batch 7.2\n",
      "Processing: You may also just be wondering if it's a good phone or not So I think the best way to describe this phone is it's a nearly perfect Samsung phone so what I mean by that is if you've liked Samsung phones in the past or you have an old Samsung phone and you like what they do with the software with the great CAMERAs with the awesome design with their build then this is the best and most complete version of that that they've ever made But conversely if you already don't like Samsung phones like if slow Android updates aren't your thing Or you just don't like what they do with the skin then this isn't going to change your mind So it's a nearly perfect Samsung phone So last year the Galaxy S8 had the infiniti display this year again Galaxy S9 has one of the absolute best displays in any smartphone sandwiched between even slightly thinner top and bottom SCREEN_OR_DISPLAYs than last time and they've even done a slightly better job hiding the CAMERAs and things in that top SCREEN_OR_DISPLAY so the black looks more seamless and that earpiece also now doubles as a second BUILD_QUALITY front--facing BUILD_QUALITY so you kind of have a bit of a stereo BUILD_QUALITY thing going on here it's not quite the same obviously as two big dedicated front--facing BUILD_QUALITYs but at least now it's a bit louder and clearer if you accidentally block the bottom BUILD_QUALITY which can happen you don't completely miss what's going on so it's better last year you also had USBC and BATTERY_OR_CHARGING fast charging all that that is also all still here USBC fast-charging BATTERY_OR_CHARGING a headphone jack water resistance is great clicky buttons and just overall a plus build quality now it's still BUILD_QUALITY which means you're still going to get smudges So if you want to pick up a dbrand skin this new black camo might not make your phone invisible but it'll make all the smudges and scratches disappear And then the biggest change on the outside has to be obviously the fingerprint reader placement. It's now in the middle instead of up at the top next to the CAMERA and that makes a huge difference even more than people are giving it credit for it's perfect.\n",
      "Finished processing transcript 7 - batch 7.3\n",
      "Processing: Now it's raised slightly so it's easy to know when your fingers on it when you're not looking at it and registering your fingerprint is now just a slow swipe like you roll your finger down the scanner once which is actually really cool. I thought it was a glitch.\n",
      "Finished processing transcript 7 - batch 7.4\n",
      "Processing: Usually you kind of you know you have to press it on the fingerprint reader a whole bunch of times to enroll your finger. But during this phone setup, you just roll your finger down at once and it's a hundred percent done.\n",
      "Finished processing transcript 7 - batch 7.5\n",
      "Processing: That is awesome. And then there's also now on the back of this phone, a blood pressure CAMERA in addition to the heart rate monitor.\n",
      "Finished processing transcript 7 - batch 7.6\n",
      "Processing: So the heart rate monitor is not new. We've had that for a while.\n",

      "Processing: You can measure your heart rate. that's quick.\n",
      "Finished processing transcript 7 - batch 7.8\n",
      "Processing: but the blood pressure CAMERA usually, you haven't been able to do that with anything other than like the wrap and the tools in the doctor's office to actually get that reading in that number. I wasn't able to get that reading with S health or any of the health apps on my phone.\n",
      "Finished processing transcript 7 - batch 7.9\n",
      "Processing: but I like a really good CAMERA from Dave2D on how exactly this works. There's a certain way to get it to help you if you do want to use this phone to measure blood pressure But as of right now it's just a pretty cool new addition Last year's galaxy S8 also had top--notch specs when it came out S9 here Keeps that up and bumps it up too again for 2018. snapdragon 845 and four or six gigs of ram And this does definitely feel like the smoothest Samsung phone yet it still doesn't match stock Android, you know there's still little performance hiccups like when opening up bixby for example and occasionally and some other Samsung apps uh, but in my couple of weeks with this phone that's about it everything else nearly matches pixel 2 and smoothness and I'm really happy about that and then there is all the Samsung software Uh again they're still really not shy about their colorful look on top of Android so it's not going to change your mind if you already dislike the Samsung stuff But it's all better.\n",
      "Finished processing transcript 7 - batch 8.0\n",
      "Processing: It still has a ton of advanced features. It added iris scanning from the note which is a little slower but more secure than regular facial recognition using the front-facing CAMERA.\n",
      "Finished processing transcript 7 - batch 8.1\n",
      "Processing: And there's also a new intelligent scan which combines face scanning and iris scanning Basically using which one works better depending on light conditions. So I'm really into the new fingerprint reader.\n",
      "Finished processing transcript 7 - batch 8.2\n",
      "Processing: so I haven't necessarily used these as much but it's cool to have all the options. It still has a bunch of Samsung's big screen tricks and app shortcuts You still get the edge shortcuts and some more customization options with those Sometimes with all the stuff.\n",
      "Finished processing transcript 7 - batch 8.3\n",
      "Processing: It can feel like Samsung is just kind of dumping as many features as possible on you and maybe they are but that's part of what they do. It still has Bixby and the Bixby button and everything Bixby's good for, Okay, I could have just disabled the Bixby button from day one.\n",
      "Finished processing transcript 7 - batch 8.4\n",
      "Processing: I know that but I decided to give it another chance. I've left it enabled since day one every day using Bixby and it's still not that great.\n",
      "Finished processing transcript 7 - batch 8.5\n",
      "Processing: Not only have I triggered it a couple times on purpose but many times by accident when taking it out of my pocket And every time I open it I just kind of scroll down hoping to find something useful in these cards. Uh, but usually I don't.\n",
      "Finished processing transcript 7 - batch 8.6\n",
      "Processing: So then I close it Bixby voice can still do a lot of those like really intricate digging into the settings and longer strings of commands in the phone that other assistants can't do as well. So that's pretty cool.\n",
      "Finished processing transcript 7 - batch 8.7\n",
      "Processing: So, uh, turn on the CAMERAlight so if you're into that if that's something you do on your phone often you'll like bixby when it understands you but I'm not that person so I'm gonna go ahead and disable it for now so yeah this is clearly still unapologetically a samsung phone in a software department for better or for worse there's still two browsers out the box two smart assistants two calendars two messaging apps all the classic half--hearted Samsung ecosystem push is still there but it's also Android so you can get rid of that stuff that's annoying if you don't want it battery life I think is the biggest weakness of these new phones the s9 and s9 plus it's not terrible but among all the other great things about these phones the battery life is definitely not great so I spend most of my time with the s9 plus which has the bigger screen, but also bigger battery 3. 500 milliamp hours and it would be dead by the end of the day and most of my heavy use days with a lot of navigation.\n",
      "Finished processing transcript 7 - batch 8.8\n",

      "Finished processing transcript 7 - batch 8.9\n",
      "Processing: I don't even do that much mobile gaming, but if I were, that, would kill it too. The upside of that, as it always is with Samsung is fast charging and BATTERY_OR_CHARGING.\n",
      "Finished processing transcript 7 - batch 9.0\n",
      "Processing: It charges really fast with the right charger the one in the box, of course, uh, or one of several other USBC chargers like the MacBook Pro charger but it can be kind of picky The dash charger for example, didn't work if you're curious. But being able to top up really quickly during the day for me I've said this before it does offset the slightly weak battery this phone has it would be great if it had better battery But for me that's good enough depends on who you are and then for the biggest most reimagined new change in these phones that would be the CAMERA let's break that down So there's a new 12 CAMERA CAMERA on the back and if you get the s9 plus it gets the second teleCAMERA CAMERA as well And it's the first modern smartphone with a variable aperture CAMERA It can physically switch between f 1.5 and f 2.4 depending on your lighting So it defaults to F 2.4 which is roughly average for a smartphone CAMERA actually and that's for your sharp normal daylight CAMERAs Most of the time when you do get to CAMERA under 100 Lux that's when it's going to switch to wide open F 1.5 Technically speaking the mechanism to do this is really impressive but it only matters if you can see the difference in CAMERAs.\n",
      "Finished processing transcript 7 - batch 9.1\n",
      "Processing: So does it make a difference So alright generally CAMERAs from the Galaxy S9 CAMERA are pretty damn good CAMERAs are a little bit less over processed and a little less over sharpened than they used to be But it's clearly still the Samsung look we're used to with the bright vibrant colors dynamic range I'd say is the most noticeable improvement But that's something they've actively worked on so it's good to see something you'll notice looking through all of these though is Samsung's tendency to overexpose still pretty much every CAMERA I take on the Galaxy S9 in auto mode is just a little bit too bright it's just just a little bit but then it can also be a sort of an advantage when you take it to low-light galaxy S9 Low light CAMERAs look pretty good And that really is thanks to the F 1.5 aperture letting in way more light. So the question of is this variable aperture making a difference?\n",
      "Finished processing transcript 7 - batch 9.2\n",
      "Processing: Well CAMERA shots have seen a real bump up there's less smoothing because it gets rid of less grain because there's less grain because there's more light being led into the CAMERA. So fundamentally yes, it's working.\n",
      "Finished processing transcript 7 - batch 9.3\n",
      "Processing: It's still not the best CAMERA in any smartphone though. that's still pixel 2 hands-down and I'd say it still falls a little bit behind iphone 10 But I don't think anyone will be disappointed with the third place performance of a great Galaxy S9 CAMERA.\n",
      "Finished processing transcript 7 - batch 9.4\n",
      "Processing: Something people have also noticed recently is it shoots CAMERA in the REC 2020 color space instead of REC 709 That's what happens when you turn on or leave on HDR. If you turn that off they can be REC 709.\n",

      "Finished processing transcript 7 - batch 9.6\n",
      "Processing: So all right, back in the impressions CAMERA, I did mention that it seems like Galaxy S9 plus will have a pretty big advantage over the regular Galaxy S9 because you're getting now more PHONE_PERFORMANCE, more screen, more battery and more CAMERA.

It's perfect for the Samsung lover, but I as you probably already know am not that person I will be switching back I think to my pixel 2 as a daily so with the Galaxy S9 it makes it really easy to under appreciate it because it seems like you know, oh it's just a minor upgrade.\n",

      "Processing: First of all it is the master of one. The display there isn't really any better than this but it's actually so good at so many different things and bad at so few things especially being so good at the hardware suite, that's what makes this phone so easy to recommend.\n",

      "Processing: And this is a Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra and it's an incredibly good phone I gotta say now the thing is not only does it do a lot on paper because we already know about the big numbers the huge specs the ultra story that's all still here but it does a lot of stuff that doesn't show up on the spec sheet a lot of subtle tweaks and changes that turn this from a really good phone to a great one So of course I gotta start with the finish because well I've been saying matte black everything for a solid couple of years now To the point where it's it's on a shirt. my car probably my most precious possession is wrapped in matte black and its name is phantom So I guess you could say this phantom black galaxy S21 Ultra.\n",

      "Processing: But everything else about this design, I think is as good as it gets. I was kind of worried.\n",
      "Finished processing transcript 9 - batch 9.9\n",
      "Processing: It would look great out the box actually. And then just collect a ton of fingerprints.\n",
      "Finished processing transcript 9 - batch 10.0\n",
      "Processing: And look awful. But this map black has been shockingly good at rejecting fingerprints.\n",
      "Finished processing transcript 9 - batch 10.1\n",
      "Processing: So that's sweet. Something you might have noticed also is Samsung has a carbon fiber weave in the CAMERA module for like every other color of this phone except for phantom black for some reason.\n",

      "Finished processing transcript 9 - batch 10.4\n",
      "Processing: It's actually largely the same phone. It's got a lot of the same big numbers.\n",
      "Finished processing transcript 9 - batch 10.5\n",
      "Processing: The Ultra stuff is still here. but there's a lot of small intangibles, a lot of small adjustments that they've made that I really like Probably more than you think and then like I don't know how to say this without sounding kind of full of it.\n",
      "Finished processing transcript 9 - batch 10.6\n",
      "Processing: But I feel like this phone was designed by or maybe at least worked on by people who have watched MKBHD CAMERAs. Does that make sense?\n",

      "Processing: Like there's there's a lot of things in here and of course there's a lot of people out there who have the same tastes and will like a lot of these changes in any phone. But yeah this this exact phone feels more like an MKBHD edition phone than any phone i've ever reviewed.\n",
      "Finished processing transcript 9 - batch 10.8\n",
      "Processing: So you got to start up front with that display. This has been a strength of Samsung and their phones for years.\n",
      "Finished processing transcript 9 - batch 10.9\n",
      "Processing: So you can expect good stuff. And you see that with the improvements on paper right.\n",
      "Finished processing transcript 9 - batch 11.0\n",
      "Processing: This is a huge SCREEN_OR_DISPLAY that will finally do 1440p CAMERA and 120 Hertz at the same time it gets even brighter up to 1500 SCREEN_OR_DISPLAY tops so it's viewable in pretty much any conditions and the new LTPO panel tech makes it actively vary its SCREEN_OR_DISPLAY between 10 hertz and 120 hertz to save battery but from my experience has stayed very responsive I've never noticed a dip in frame rate in everyday use so it's managing it really well which is a success but even with all that stuff that's on the spec sheet there's also all the stuff that's not on paper, like the fact that they keep flattening the display even more than last year This one doesn't spill over the edges kind of at all anymore obviously like that. it's also a little bit smaller, and the body of this phone.\n",
      "Finished processing transcript 9 - batch 11.1\n",
      "Processing: it's still a big phone, don't get me wrong, but it's not like stupid big like here it is compared to iphone 12 Pro max another pretty big phone but it's actually a smaller footprint here and next to the oneplus 8 Pro it's still huge but doesn't seem so overbearingly massive right it's actually smaller than the galaxy S20 ultra going from a 6.9 inch to a 6.8 inch display and also the fingerprint CAMERA is new I guess that would be on paper too but they've switched to a newer generation qualcomm under display fingerprint reader and that reader is noticeably bigger it's 1.77 times the size of last year I didn't notice it being any faster even though it claimed to be but just the larger CAMERA area by itself makes the experience of using the fingerprint CAMERA all the time much less frustrating I have less failed attempts it feels less finicky and maybe someday the whole bottom of the phone will be a fingerprint CAMERA. But until then in this world of wearing masks, the improved fingerprint reader is welcome.\n",

      "Processing: So also on paper Snapdragon triple eight inside 12 or 16 gigs of PHONE_PERFORMANCE depending on which spec you get fast UFS 3.1 PHONE_PERFORMANCE, not expandable, which is technically a downgrade from last year, but it's something I haven't personally used in a long time then high SCREEN_OR_DISPLAY display and a 5, 000 milliamp hour battery. So this phone is clearly a flagship performer on paper but off paper, there are a lot of improvements to one UI three on this phone that do probably make a more meaningful difference to the user experience versus just the bleeding edge specs Now i've said before I'm not the biggest fan of Samsung's software and their UI, Honestly, I i've preferred close to stock, maybe Oxygen OS is my favorite non--stock option but you can't sleep on Samsung software.\n",
      "Finished processing transcript 9 - batch 11.3\n",
      "Processing: The whole reason they do what they do is to offer as many features as possible and they are still at it. There are tons of features packed into these phones that have a lot of potential for customization and just letting you tailor it to behave the way you want.\n",
      "Finished processing transcript 9 - batch 11.4\n",
      "Processing: You never have to dive in and use any or all of the features because there's a lot, but they'll be waiting for you if you have the time to mess with them. I think the stuff you'll first notice with S21 Ultra is the new volume control here, those sliders just a little cleaner looking and one UI3, the new notification grouping on top of Android.\n",
      "Finished processing transcript 9 - batch 11.5\n",
      "Processing: Just an overall cleaner aesthetic and organization to things like that. The stock apps and the improved dark mode that I highly recommend looks great on this oled display and can actually net you a little bit of extra battery life, but also the Google Discover page to the side of the home screen.\n",
      "Finished processing transcript 9 - batch 11.6\n",

      "Finished processing transcript 9 - batch 11.8\n",
      "Processing: But, hey, if I worked at Samsung, and I kept asking for a Google Play edition for all these years, I guess we know that's probably never going to happen again. But this is a little taste to that.\n",
      "Finished processing transcript 9 - batch 11.9\n",
      "Processing: It's as close as it's going to get. I do kind of wish the search box showed up over here too.\n",
      "Finished processing transcript 9 - batch 12.0\n",
      "Processing: like it does in the Google app. But, hey, this is solid.\n",
      "Finished processing transcript 9 - batch 12.1\n",
      "Processing: And I guess if they let me map Bixby to Google assistant, all over the phone, that would have been the cherry on top. But anyway, speaking of battery, we again have an ultra number it's 5, 000 milliamp hours and that looks great on paper right In practice, I've had a very good battery experience now the thing to note which is an ongoing conversation is the qualcomm snapdragon chip experience versus in other regions there's an exynos version so this year with this phone it would be snapdragon triple eight versus the exynos 2100.\n",
      "Finished processing transcript 9 - batch 12.2\n",
      "Processing: Now the initial testing results show a pretty promising Basically for those who haven't known or haven't been filled in uh, usually the xnos version is much worse with battery life and performance in those regions. Initial testing is uh pretty promising for the exynos 2100 I'm going to leave that actual conclusion getting to people who can get their hands on both phones but for now with my experience on the qualcomm phone very good battery life on one day I got four hours of BATTERY_OR_CHARGING and ended around 50 percent.\n",
      "Finished processing transcript 9 - batch 12.3\n",
      "Processing: The next day I had around five hours had a little less at the end of the day, I never once killed it in a single day. it's pretty clear that the combination of the triple eight chip and the LTPO display tech are working well here, I'd say it has what I'd call a worry-free battery.\n",
      "Finished processing transcript 9 - batch 12.4\n",
      "Processing: don't even really have to think about it too much with some super heavy use and navigation and bright screen outdoors all the time and gaming taking lots of CAMERAs and CAMERAs and maybe maybe you'll get to the end of the battery. But hey, while we're here let's talk CAMERAs they are a big part of the ultra a phone experience both figuratively and literally speaking.\n",
      "Finished processing transcript 9 - batch 12.5\n",
      "Processing: So they hit all the check boxes of big ultra numbers again 108 CAMERAs 100 times CAMERA 8k CAMERA, all that stuff is still here. I would say the experience has actually changed more than the CAMERA quality.\n",
      "Finished processing transcript 9 - batch 12.6\n",
      "Processing: Photo quality is still roughly what we'd expect from a high-end Samsung phone. And I'll get to that in a second.\n",
      "Finished processing transcript 9 - batch 12.7\n",
      "Processing: But there are more changes to how you get to that CAMERA and CAMERA that are better. there's countless examples of this.\n",
      "Finished processing transcript 9 - batch 12.8\n",
      "Processing: So right when you first open the CAMERA app, Samsung asks you if you want to take natural or bright selfies instead of just defaulting to bright all the time I'm glad they added that option. They didn't have to But that results in much more natural selfies from that 40 CAMERA CAMERA for someone like me with my skin tone right off the bat instead of having to mess with the exposure slider then the 100x space CAMERA which yes is definitely extreme and probably still a gimmick to most people.\n",
      "Finished processing transcript 9 - batch 12.9\n",
      "Processing: It got a lot more stable and easier to use thanks to the subject locking in the viewfinder. So now when you're CAMERAed all the way in on something, the CAMERA tries to identify the subject of the CAMERA you're taking and locks the viewfinder to track that instead of shaking around so much, it is slightly annoying when you're like locked on to something that's not quite what you're trying to shoot.\n",
      "Finished processing transcript 9 - batch 13.0\n",
      "Processing: And then you have to try to adjust it, probably CAMERA out and CAMERA back in. But when it correctly picks your subject.\n",
      "Finished processing transcript 9 - batch 13.1\n",
      "Processing: it's great. The results are still insane and not super usable.\n",
      "Finished processing transcript 9 - batch 13.2\n",
      "Processing chunk: but hey , if you were using 100x before , you ' ll be happier with how much easier it is to use in this new version you of course have the laser autofocus added to fix the autofocus issues we saw with the s20 ultra and i ' d say in 75 percent of cases it works it sometimes still humps a little bit with the really close up subjects but for the most part it ' s solved and then the camera app also now auto detects when you ' re trying to take an extreme close - - up and switches to macro but it ' s not a separate macro camera as you may have noticed this phone doesn ' t have one because it doesn ' t need one it uses the ultra wide camera which has autofocus and a super close minimum focus distance so it actually takes really solid quality macros and it does 4k 60fps camera from all the cameras now including the selfie camera and it ' ll shoot 12 - - bit raw cameras in\n",
      "Processing chunk: pro mode which is an awesome capability that i i ' ll probably rarely actually use personally kind of like the 108 camera mode but it ' s definitely a nice to have they even added things like the director ' s view which lets you record camera from multiple cameras simultaneously which is enabled by the snapdragon triple eight potentially really useful for vlog style shooting and the use of two telecamera cameras a 3x and a 10x seemed peculiar at first but i ' ve found it actually makes a lot of sense so like i could live without the 10x and most people also could and the s21s don ' t have it and that ' s fine but samsung ' s committed to offering that quality super far camera on this phone so if they did the 10x by itself and not the 3x well then everything from 1x to 10x would be digital camera on the main camera and that ' s not ideal so if they only did the 3x and not the 10x well then everything\n",
      "Processing chunk: from 3x in that super far range wouldn ' t be quite up to the ultra standard so they have a 3x and a 10x and so now everything from 1 to 3x is camera on the primary camera everything from 3x to 10x is either on the primary or the second camera just depending on what the lighting situation is and then everything from 10x and beyond is of course on that little periscope camera and that ' s delivering some of the best 10x to 30x camera cameras that i ' m seeing on any smartphone so that ' s accomplishing what samsung set out to do now is it perfect no no camera ' s perfect . it still misses shots .\n",
      "Finished processing transcript 9 - batch 13.3\n",
      "Processing: It still does 8k at only 24 FPs, the wrong frame rate and most notably it definitely still fringes on the edges with close--up subjects absolutely But overall they've controlled it a lot more with color and HDR and focus and so overall the look is what you'd expect just you easier to get. So at the end of the day, when you go down the list with the S21 Ultra, they did it like this.\n",
      "Finished processing transcript 9 - batch 13.4\n",
      "Processing: This is the phone that would have come out the lab if you handed me an S20 Ultra and said, all right, go ahead and make any improvements you want. This is what I would have made.\n",

      "Processing: now, this phone, actually the whole S23 lineup, has a snapdragon 8 gen 2 for galaxy, a customized version of the chip, specifically for these samsung phones. so if you watched the last CAMERA about how Apple's taking back the iphone, then you know already that optimization and customization for parts inside phones is a good thing, generally.\n",
      "Finished processing transcript 11 - batch 11.8\n",
      "Processing: but the only thing that we've really seen that is customized for this chip for galaxy is a slightly higher max clock speed on the performance core and slightly higher clock speed on the gpU. so to be exact, 3.36gSCREEN_OR_DISPLAY instead of 3.2 on the performance core and 719mSCREEN_OR_DISPLAY versus 680 on the gpU.\n",
      "Finished processing transcript 11 - batch 11.9\n",
      "Processing: so yeah, it does score slightly better on benchmarks than the regular snapdragon 8 gen 2, and that's nice for a little extra headroom for high performance stuff, light gaming and for future-proofing, but that's not the whole story. there's two main things that matter here, one is efficiency gains.\n",
      "Finished processing transcript 11 - batch 12.0\n",
      "Processing: so, obviously performance is awesome, but because efficiency is better, these phones get some serious battery life gains that we'll talk in a second. but also too, is bye-bye exynos, because they're not making an exynos version of this phone as far as I can tell anywhere else.\n",

      "Processing: now, the fundamentals are mostly the same, which is why this probably gets written off so quickly a lot. the layout, the aesthetics, the focal lengths, the arrangement, it's all practically the same, but we have a new 200-CAMERA primary CAMERA with double the CAMERA CAMERA stabilization range as before.\n",

      "Finished processing transcript 11 - batch 12.9\n",
      "Processing: this new primary CAMERA setup though, I know we keep saying CAMERAs are mostly software, and as far as the look and style of the CAMERAs, it absolutely still is, but the improvement to the stabilization is so important here. so when you go from a normal CAMERA to a super-high CAMERA 200-CAMERA CAMERA, the fact is, in these tiny smartphone CAMERAs, the individual pixels are so small that individually, they physically can't bring in that much light.\n",
      "Finished processing transcript 11 - batch 13.0\n",
      "Processing: so the CAMERA does this thing called binning, where it combines the information from a bunch of adjacent pixels to form larger more accurate pixels in your CAMERA. so you're not shooting 200 CAMERAs by default, it's actually binning 16 pixels into one, so you end up taking a 12.5 CAMERA shot for normal CAMERAs, but each CAMERA is theoretically more accurate thanks to its makeup.\n",
      "Finished processing transcript 11 - batch 13.1\n",
      "Processing: and then like I said, the stabilization performance on this new primary CAMERA has doubled. (phone rattles) still rattles a little bit, but that means it'll correct up to three degrees of shake now versus the 1.5 from before, so here's an example of what's happening.\n",
      "Finished processing transcript 11 - batch 13.2\n",
      "Processing: if you get a CAMERA with really good CAMERA CAMERA stabilization, (CAMERA rattles) like this one, that means it can correct from the movement in your hand much more, which means you can hold the CAMERA stable for much longer, so it can leave the CAMERA open to collect more light and still get a sharp CAMERA. so, all of this is to say galaxy s23 ultra CAMERAs, most of the time, in most lighting, look pretty similar to last year.\n",
      "Finished processing transcript 11 - batch 13.3\n",
      "Processing: so if that's all you're looking at, just normal side by sides, this is mostly gonna come down to the different software tuning, and there's a little bit more dynamic range than last year, but yeah, still top of the line while mostly avoiding looking to HDR-Y. CAMERAs are typically pretty warm from these Samsung phones, and they have a slightly punchier, more contrasty look than before, still very much up the Samsung alley of colorful and saturated, but it's an aesthetic that I can get behind, I really like.\n",
      "Finished processing transcript 11 - batch 13.4\n",
      "Processing: but, on top of that, having this new CAMERA and CAMERA stabilization means one, you can shoot literally 200-CAMERA CAMERAs now if you really want to. now, this does accomplish the intended purpose of capturing much more of the finer detail in things like landscapes, so if you plan on CAMERAing in on the shot later, or if you're one of the three people on Earth who will actually print a smartphone CAMERA, this should work, but you should also be aware that it's only really able to give you these types of results in excellent lighting where a ton of light is hitting every individual little pixel.\n",
      "Finished processing transcript 11 - batch 13.5\n",
      "Processing: anything short of that, and you're gonna get a lot of noise really quick. and there's also a really solid CAMERA lag as it turns out these massive 40, 50 megabyte files, granted this mode is mostly for things sitting still, like a landscape or a CAMERA shoot but worth noting.\n",
      "Finished processing transcript 11 - batch 13.6\n",
      "Processing: I think the better compromise is you actually also get a 50-CAMERA mode, which kicks out still very detailed CAMERAs that hang right with the iphone's 48-CAMERA proraw shots in a variety of light, but now the files are five megabytes, and there's a lot of less CAMERA lag. but there's still that improved detail over the normal binge shots and not as much noise.\n",

So this is where Apple does its absolute best to make Sure specs don't matter nearly as much as I used to they control the entire experience from the hardware to the software and there's a lot of optimization going on and in the end performance throughout ios 7 is pretty snappy.\n",

The motto here is you'll probably like it or learn to like it but if you don't too bad because you just can't change things you still can't customize a lot of the things that i'm used to being able to customize out-of-the-box on something like an Android phone In ios 7 you'll probably like most of the new icons but if you don't like one or two or several too bad you might like the new keyboard but if you don't too bad you might love the new stock lockscreen or the new dialer or all the new stock applications But if you don't too bad My biggest gripe with ios 7 was actually the animation So every time I unlock the iphone 5s there was this new animation in ios 7.\n",

      "Processing: There's also a lot of weird little bits of fragmentation like with the keyboard for example where if the app you're using isn't updated for ios 7, it doesn't get to use Apple's new keyboard goodies the old ios 7 looking keyboard which creates a bit of visual inconsistency and that will I guess be a bit of a mess until app developers get on the case and update their apps for the new OS.

Of course people have also found great ways to register things other than fingers, like their toes, their pets, toes, and even other body parts.\n",

      "Processing: just note that every time you restart your phone, you'll have to re-enter your whole Itunes password before using touch ID and app store. Again, another thing that's great about the iphone is the CAMERA experience, the CAMERA experience in my opinion is made up of two different parts.\n",
      "Finished processing transcript 12 - batch 15.9\n",
      "Processing: It's the quality and the control and there's a little bit of the scale I'd say between one and ten for quality and between one and ten for control. A lot of devices that have ten out of ten for quality like the Lumia 1020. for example.\n",

      "Processing: So characterize the CAMERA on the back of the iphone 5s as a very fast CAMERA and a bunch of different ways fast number one because it's very fast to take CAMERAs and to process shots.

But if you're trying to decide between the six and the six plus, consider this all of the factors that make the iphone 6 a little bit slippery and a little bit difficult to hold on the hand, are amplified on the iphone 6 Plus, it's an even bigger phone in every single way, and it's still rounded on the edges, so it's even more difficult to grip.\n",

Maybe this is the middle ground that we were asking Htc to take all along all the CAMERAs it takes are very clean the CAMERA tends to have a bias towards a faster CAMERA speed kind of like the oneplus one to avoid blurriness so it's willing to crank up the ISO and just trust its top-notch CAMERA processing to clean things up and that's really where it's separated it has great CAMERA processing and this does a pretty good job of cleaning up noise which makes some crispy clean shots with excellent color The only downside of this CAMERA I would say is the fact that it's only 8 CAMERAs which means no 4k CAMERA 4k is actually 8.3 CAMERAs so this 8 CAMERA CAMERA means this iphone will not shoot 4k CAMERA until the next one So overall like I said before this whole phone is a very familiar phone a safe upgrade for previous iphone users for sure if you just straight up look at the numbers you'll see a 1.4 gigahertz dual core chip and one gig of PHONE_PERFORMANCE but the thing performs like any other phone with a 2.5 gigahertz chip and three gigs of PHONE_PERFORMANCE so you can thank Apple's vertical integration and the awesome A8 chip for that So with the iphone 6 you're getting a great performer, a great CAMERA, a great display and a great design all in a super thin package So with a super thin phone you also get a super thin battery so the iphone 6 is rocking a 810 milliamp hour battery on paper that's really small and you might consider that super small by other phone standards by Android phone standards by other flagship standards by other 4.7 inch phone standards but Apple has the advantage of, at least it owns that A8 chip.\n",

It's the same dimensions actually so old cases will work with it as well, Same CAMERA bump, same general look it just looks like an iphone.\n",
      "Finished processing transcript 15 - batch 15.1\n",
      "Processing: Again the one biggest difference besides the new colors is the BUILD_QUALITY on the back So this BUILD_QUALITY is a bit heavier, a bit grippier actually than rounded metal and a bit more fingerprinty. Naturally but most of all it's more breakable than aluminum.\n",
      "Finished processing transcript 15 - batch 15.2\n",
      "Processing: So that's something to note. even if you are using the strongest BUILD_QUALITY ever Apple it's BUILD_QUALITY, the thin finish is really nice though as you'd expect everything on the back of the phone is underneath the BUILD_QUALITY.\n",
      "Finished processing transcript 15 - batch 15.3\n",
      "Processing: So the Apple logo is no longer a cutout in the metal, it's behind the BUILD_QUALITY, that iphone logo, the text is behind the BUILD_QUALITY, even the dual CAMERA is under the BUILD_QUALITY So it's all smooth to the touch.

You know what you're getting yourself into You know exactly how to use it and if there's maybe one big new feature every year it takes you two seconds to learn it and you're good iphone 10 is different with this phone there's maybe three or four big fundamental changes to the way you use the phone now it's very clearly still an iphone you still mostly know how to use it but there's a couple things that are different that you'll have to get used to so on the outside it's the shape we're used to the rectangle with rounded corners But this is the first time the display itself actually has curved corners and it's pushed right up to the edges of the phone or at least closer than they've ever been The commercials make it seem a little more dramatic than it actually is But hey, it's 2017 phones have small SCREEN_OR_DISPLAYs that's just the way they are now so in that way the iphone catches up and it pushes everything to the corners and keeps all the front--facing CAMERAs in the notch that forsaken notch at the top.\n",

I think it's an awesome size but if there were a bigger iphone 10 plus I would totally get that right now Despite the larger display the 10 is definitely closer to feeling like an iphone 8 than an 8 plus It still feels like a smaller phone compared to the others I've used and also thanks to the stainless steel sides, it's definitely slippery and it's definitely going to slide out of your pocket at least once it happens to the best of them and it's crazy.\n",

I've just kind of accepted that at this point But because of the new orientation a couple times I've noticed it's easy to accidentally get your finger in the CAMERA or CAMERA you're taking just because it's all up in the corner.\n",

      "Processing: It might take a couple days to get used to that and stop getting your finger in the corner of your shots. But what's really become the signature feature of the iphone 10 is around the front and it is that notch up at the top of the display And there are two camps with this.\n",

      "Finished processing transcript 16 - batch 17.1\n",
      "Processing: And just like with the essential phone I tend to fall more in camp number two when you want to make a 2017 phone and you want to shrink the SCREEN_OR_DISPLAYs you still have to put all the front-facing CAMERAs, all of the CAMERAs and the IR blaster and the depth CAMERA you have to put that somewhere. In 2017, some manufacturers keep a smaller traditional SCREEN_OR_DISPLAY to house it, some try to go no top SCREEN_OR_DISPLAY and put everything in the chin.\n",
      "Finished processing transcript 16 - batch 17.2\n",
      "Processing: some try to minimize all the SCREEN_OR_DISPLAYs and use a sort of a cut out notch. Apple has decided to go with a notch and I don't mind it.\n",
      "Finished processing transcript 16 - batch 17.3\n",
      "Processing: In fact I literally don't even think about it anymore in everyday use. Now obviously when you're focusing on it here as I'm talking about it and highlighting it on CAMERA, it's really obvious you know the unibrow at the top, it kind of just becomes a part of this iphone 10s character.\n",
      "Finished processing transcript 16 - batch 17.4\n",
      "Processing: But you're never really looking at it during normal use, like flipping through apps, scrolling through Twitter, Instagram, whatever it disappears pretty quick. Now not everybody feels this way clearly like I've seen all the clever like hiding the notch stuff all the apps and the wallpapers and that I get that, uh, but because this is Apple and because they're stubborn and will never admit that any of their solutions are anything other than perfect, they've come up with the opposite solution, which is embrace the notch.\n",
      "Finished processing transcript 16 - batch 17.5\n",
      "Processing: So in all their software and all the software they'll promote is apps that wrap right around that notch and fill up the whole display. that's what an optimized iphone 10 app looks like.\n",
      "Finished processing transcript 16 - batch 17.6\n",
      "Processing: And since this is a taller aspect ratio apps will have to get updated to do this. Developers will have to get on their horse and actually put in the work and update their apps to get them to fill up the display like this.\n",
      "Finished processing transcript 16 - batch 17.7\n",
      "Processing: And to be fair, most of the big name apps are already upgrading and embracing the notch like Apple wants, but there are still plenty that haven',t updated yet, and they'll be obvious when you see them, because they'll have these big SCREEN_OR_DISPLAYs about the top and the bottom kind of like you're using them on an iphone 8 again. So, slowly over the next couple of weeks, and months, all the apps you're using will get updated to embrace that notch, whether you like it or not.\n",
      "Finished processing transcript 16 - batch 17.8\n",

      "Finished processing transcript 16 - batch 17.9\n",
      "Processing: So, for the record, the only time I really think about that notch is when I'm watching CAMERAs. Yes, it gets kind of awkward here because when you're watching CAMERAs full screen the notch will cut off some of the display, some of what you're trying to watch so if you want to avoid that, you can actually double tap and it'll bring in the CAMERA you're watching on this oleD display.\n",
      "Finished processing transcript 16 - batch 18.0\n",

      "Finished processing transcript 16 - batch 18.1\n",
      "Processing: So this whole thing is the main reason why I would actually want a plus sized iphone 10. anyway as for the rest of the display it's great Apple calls it a super retina display I just call it their first SCREEN_OR_DISPLAY in a smartphone ever. Finally And it's it's pretty awesome.\n",
      "Finished processing transcript 16 - batch 18.2\n",

      "Processing: It doesn't get as bright and saturated as Samsung's like note 8 and S8 displays but it is still bright enough. Not too cartoonish with the colors has a small blue shift when you tilt it off axis but so do many other oleds to varying degrees and it still has 3d touch Although I pretty much stopped using that completely except for lock screen controls that I wish I could change so the screen is awesome And it's a big part of why this phone looks so good from so many angles.\n",
      "Finished processing transcript 16 - batch 18.4\n",

      "Finished processing transcript 16 - batch 18.5\n",
      "Processing: So that's why iphone 10 replaces that home button with a whole bunch of gestures. This is the biggest learning curve of any iphone ever.\n",
      "Finished processing transcript 16 - batch 18.6\n",
      "Processing: But it's still not that bad. You swipe up from that bar at the bottom of the screen at any time to go home.\n",

      "Processing: Now, anytime you see that bar, it represents the home And whatever app you're in will close itself just like any other iphone hitting the home button, swipe down from the top for notifications, but now swipe from the right corner for your control center. And then for PHONE_PERFORMANCE, again, you have no home button.\n",
      "Finished processing transcript 16 - batch 18.8\n",
      "Processing: So you swipe halfway up and then over to get through your recent apps, that'll get you to that same card style carousel as before, But overall, once you get hang of this system, Once you get used to all this swiping, which took me a couple days, it felt pretty natural. I actually started trying to swipe up on other phones, which shows you how weird how much I got used to that.\n",
      "Finished processing transcript 16 - batch 18.9\n",

      "Finished processing transcript 16 - batch 19.0\n",
      "Processing: But what you really have to do to get this to work is you swipe up and over, and that gets you to the cards way faster. So, that's a pro tip for anyone who is still swiping up halfway and waiting for the cards to show up Like I was, you're welcome.\n",
      "Finished processing transcript 16 - batch 19.1\n",
      "Processing: And for those with small hands or who just really liked reachability on the bigger iphone, you technically still have it here. It's buried in the accessibility settings, but you can do the little swipe down on the bottom of the screen to bring the top corners within reach.\n",
      "Finished processing transcript 16 - batch 19.2\n",

      "Processing: Now, of course, the other big change that comes with ditching the home button on iphone 10 is he also just ditched that fingerprint reader, Which means as you may have heard, they needed to replace that with face ID, Facial recognition, face ID on the iphone works really well. Most of the time, it's not perfect.\n",

I'll take that improvement anyway because it's for security and that's better than nothing but the variety of angles thing I don't know about you but when I read that I was hoping that meant it could sit on a table in front of you and still read and unlock your face like it couldn't before but it still doesn't do that unfortunately you still got to do that lean onto whatever surface the phone is on to unlock it so i've noticed honestly no improvement here in the angles it's basically the same other than that.\n",

Most of these improvements over the A12 are just going to help these stay faster for longer and as it's been said they'll be appreciated more near the end of the phone's life than the beginning All right I almost can't believe I made you guys wait this long for the CAMERAs so clearly the CAMERAs are if you've watched any of the ads or any of the presentation CAMERAs these CAMERAs are the main focus for the iphone 11 Pro Yes, that's a pun so you've seen it we're looking at triple CAMERAs now.\n",

Now this has been really interesting to watch unfold because it's not just a matter of dropping 120 Hertz display into the phone and then calling it a day, there's a couple different considerations and nuances and things to be able to do to do it well and then there's whether or not people even notice that's two different things so as a self--proclaimed pixel enthusiast as someone who's seen a lot of phones Apple has done this really well and it's of course an oleD but it's also an LTPO display meaning it's an adaptive variable SCREEN_OR_DISPLAY that can ramp up to 120 hertz but also now down to as low as 10 hertz it actually has 12 different SCREEN_OR_DISPLAYs that it cycles between which is seven more than the ipad Pro so this helps it respond to exactly what's happening on the display so if you're watching a 24 FPS movie the display only needs to refresh 24 times per second but if you're scrolling through a website or social media it'll be nice and smooth Maybe if you're gaming it's pinned at 120 hertz But if you're just sitting on a home screen or reading some text like an email nothing's happening on the screen It can go all the way down to 10 hertz Which can save battery So this tech has been around for years and other phones and it's great So the interesting part is different phones ramp up at different times and for different reasons and different amounts So an example is like no matter how high SCREEN_OR_DISPLAY of an Android phone, I have it's always 60 hertz for Google Maps anytime I open Google Maps the whole rest of the phone notification panel using the app.\n",
      "Finished processing transcript 19 - batch 19.9\n",
      "Processing: It's all 60 hertz probably to save battery because it's a GPS heavy app But that's one thing it always does so it turns out there have been a lot of places where people have noticed the iphone doesn't ramp all the way up to 120 hertz. In fact, a lot of places in third party apps where it still stays at 60. now I've noticed just from using a whole ton of different apps.\n",
      "Finished processing transcript 19 - batch 20.0\n",
      "Processing: I was actually pretty impressed by how many are already using 120HZ animations and all these apps inside and out felt smoother and more responsive. Also, all of ios is smoother and more responsive.\n",
      "Finished processing transcript 19 - batch 20.1\n",
      "Processing: But for those that don't, Apple has put out detailed instructions on how to make it easy for developers to update their apps to fully support promotion, exactly the way they want to. So when your favorite apps get updated, hopefully the developers include it.\n",
      "Finished processing transcript 19 - batch 20.2\n",
      "Processing: But all that being said, will regular people who get this phone even notice promotion. This is something I've thought a lot about, especially since the announcement, you know, of course, lots of other phones have gotten higher fresh rate in the past.\n",
      "Finished processing transcript 19 - batch 20.3\n",
      "Processing: But because it's an iphone, this is for millions of people who have only ever seen a 60HZ phone, their entire lives. This will be the first time they ever see a high refresh trade screen on a phone.\n",
      "Finished processing transcript 19 - batch 20.4\n",
      "Processing: And so this is, this is the thing I've been talking about for so long. So when I actually first got this phone, I started handing it to people, you know, discreetly, of course, but handing it to them like, hey, do you notice anything different about this phone?\n",
      "Finished processing transcript 19 - batch 20.5\n",
      "Processing: like swipe around, maybe hold it next to your current phone? Do you feel like it feels any different?\n",
      "Finished processing transcript 19 - batch 20.6\n",
      "Processing: And I'll be the first to admit, not as many people immediately noticed it as I was hoping like, you know, different people had different things about it. that they noticed like there's a really good CAMERA by Joshua Chang, where he did that same thing.\n",
      "Finished processing transcript 19 - batch 20.7\n",
      "Processing: He handed the phone to a bunch of people and they all had different ways of explaining what they noticed. So some of them didn't notice but some of them noticed things like text staying more crisp on the screen while you're scrolling.\n",
      "Finished processing transcript 19 - batch 20.8\n",
      "Processing: Some people just straight up noticed the better smoothness and touch responsiveness and called that out. So I'll put it this way.\n",
      "Finished processing transcript 19 - batch 20.9\n",
      "Processing: Not everyone will notice promotion right away, especially if they're not looking for it. But but I don't have I'm not crazy.\n",
      "Finished processing transcript 19 - batch 21.0\n",
      "Processing: It's not like I have special eyes or anything. So I guarantee you this if you get somebody used to 120 hertz or just high SCREEN_OR_DISPLAY in general.\n",
      "Finished processing transcript 19 - batch 21.1\n",
      "Processing: And they use this phone for a couple weeks, a couple months, and then you hand them back a 60 hertz phone they will notice that difference and they won't want to switch back to it Basically I think people who buy this Pro iphone and get used to promotion won't want to switch back to a 60hZ iphone just like people who switch to a higher fresh rate Android phone don't want to switch back either But also i'm kind of hoping Apple doesn't ship another 60hZ iphone next year. They definitely could But I'm hoping like 90 hertz at least something like that either way that's my stance on the higher fresh rate the promotion in the pro iphones clearly the implementation technically speaking is pretty great It's super color accurate.\n",
      "Finished processing transcript 19 - batch 21.2\n",
      "Processing: It's very bright It looks great and it's very smooth So despite the notch and some apps needing to be updated It's one of the best looking screens on any phone right now and going with LTPO, let these phones with their new higher fresh rates also be battery champs. So this is the second big thing about these new phones, which is, holy smokes man.\n",
      "Finished processing transcript 19 - batch 21.3\n",
      "Processing: The batteries got really good. Now there's a couple different compounding factors that all pile on top of each other to make this happen.\n",
      "Finished processing transcript 19 - batch 21.4\n",
      "Processing: The fact that the Pro motion dips below 60 hertz to save you battery when you don't need it is number one, but number two, the A15 bionic is more efficient than last year. And then the fact that these phones are actually slightly thicker and heavier to support an actually larger battery is a really big number three.\n",
      "Finished processing transcript 19 - batch 21.5\n",
      "Processing: So the battery inside the 13 Pro is about 11 larger than the 12 Pro And the 13 pro max cell is about 18 larger than the 12 Pro max. that's not a small amount And you can't actually feel it in the weight.\n",
      "Finished processing transcript 19 - batch 21.6\n",
      "Processing: These new phones are about 20 grams heavier than last year and probably heavier than the phone you're holding right now. And the results have been dope.\n",
      "Finished processing transcript 19 - batch 21.7\n",
      "Processing: I've mostly been dailying the 13 Pro here and getting six, seven hours of BATTERY_OR_CHARGING. No problem, never really killing the phone in a day.\n",
      "Finished processing transcript 19 - batch 21.8\n",
      "Processing: I'd consider that an A. and David's been testing the 13 Pro max here at the studio and getting crazy endurance numbers. He had a day with five hours of BATTERY_OR_CHARGING with 50 battery left, which is nuts.\n",
      "Finished processing transcript 19 - batch 21.9\n",
      "Processing: So I'm gonna go ahead and put the iphone 13 Pro max right up at the top of the battery champ, 2021 power rankings right now alongside a bunch of other phones with like the super massive batteries, like the Rog phone 5 and the moto-G power. So screens check batteries check.\n",
      "Finished processing transcript 19 - batch 22.0\n",
      "Processing: But once again, the biggest change with these new Pro phones is the CAMERAs again. So first of all, I really like that the 13 Pro and 13 Pro max have the exact same set of CAMERAs between them.\n",
      "Finished processing transcript 19 - batch 22.1\n",
      "Processing: So the phones are basically identical, except for screen size and battery size. So that's nice.\n",
      "Finished processing transcript 19 - batch 22.2\n",
      "Processing: Uh, but yeah, once again, big leap up with the Pro phones and their CAMERAs and they've got the CAMERA bump to go with it. And it really is a massive, like three layer CAMERA bump with this phone.\n",
      "Finished processing transcript 19 - batch 22.3\n",
      "Processing: If you don't have a case on the phone, you'll immediately notice it sits up higher, it rocks more from certain corners on a table. and it just kind of looks at you.\n",
      "Finished processing transcript 19 - batch 22.4\n",
      "Processing: Funny. Remember when we thought the iphone 12 Pro had huge CAMERAs?\n",
      "Finished processing transcript 19 - batch 22.5\n",
      "Processing: Yeah, no, this is next level, these are much larger CAMERAs and CAMERAs in here. So, we've got triple CAMERAs, still got LIDAR and a mic and a CAMERA.\n",
      "Finished processing transcript 19 - batch 22.6\n",
      "Processing: and each of these CAMERAs is better than last year in its own way. So the primary 12 CAMERA CAMERA with that even larger CAMERA shift stabilization is excellent.\n",
      "Finished processing transcript 19 - batch 22.7\n",
      "Processing: It's remarkably consistent through various lighting and indoor and outdoor scenarios. There's also, of course the CAMERAgraphic styles to choose from that I talked about in the previous CAMERA.\n",
      "Finished processing transcript 19 - batch 22.8\n",
      "Processing: I landed on Rich Contrast as my favorite, and honestly just left it there for most of my CAMERAs. Main thing.\n",
      "Finished processing transcript 19 - batch 22.9\n",
      "Processing: you'll notice that makes it better is the big CAMERA look that we had only in the Pro Max last year. So this natural bokeh is so easy now that you might find yourself having to tap to focus just a little bit more just to make sure you're focused on the right thing and you'll find that you can get that natural background blur much easier it's not always perfect there's it's still tiny smartphone optics but the natural blur is better than fake CAMERA mode blur every time so it does a great job not fringing also like some other big smartphone CAMERAs do the teleCAMERA is also better this year so it's once again a bigger CAMERA and it's also now a 3x CAMERA CAMERA instead of a 2x or 2.5 X from last year and it looks almost as good as the main CAMERA so you love to see that that consistency between different CAMERAs gives you the confidence to be able to switch between CAMERAs like it doesn't even matter which one you're using and that's more true this year than ever before now it's no S21 ultra you know you're not going to do that deep double digit CAMERAing very well.\n",
      "Finished processing transcript 19 - batch 23.0\n",
      "Processing: Some of the best periscope CAMERAs literally look crisp at 10x while the iphone is maxing out at 15 and it looks like a watercolor painting there. So it's going to be up to you to decide if that's something you care about having in your phone or not And then last but not least the ultra wide again, closing in on the corner to corner sharpness of the main CAMERA.\n",
      "Finished processing transcript 19 - batch 23.1\n",
      "Processing: it's not quite there, but this is, this is one area where I was maybe hoping to see a higher CAMERA because you're spreading this pixel count over such a wide focal range maybe 16, 24 CAMERAs even would have been cool to see just to get that true matching sharpness. Nevertheless, the CAMERAs and CAMERAs from the ultrawide are world class literally tops among any ultrawides in any smartphone.\n",
      "Finished processing transcript 19 - batch 23.2\n",
      "Processing: And it's now also capable of macro CAMERAgraphy unlike the ultra wide in the 13 and 13 mini. And honestly it's pretty good.\n",
      "Finished processing transcript 19 - batch 23.3\n",
      "Processing: So you can get pretty close right up to about two centimeters minimum focus distance and there's a pretty good amount of you know chromatic aberration and fringing and artifacting around the outside of the frames But as long as you tap to focus you can get a pretty good close-up right in the middle And it's way better than any crappy 2-CAMERA macro CAMERA has ever dreamed of being. Now I mentioned during the impressions CAMERA, the pro phones are doing this auto switching where if something comes within about 14 centimeters of the CAMERA it automatically switches to the ultra wide in macro mode doesn't tell you and doesn't let you manually switch back.\n",
      "Finished processing transcript 19 - batch 23.4\n",
      "Processing: Honestly it's the most annoying part of using this CAMERA To me, I take plenty of close-ups of objects because I have no friends, I guess. And every time I switch to the ultrawides macro, it produces an objectively worse looking CAMERA.\n",
      "Finished processing transcript 19 - batch 23.5\n",
      "Processing: So Apple's reached out and they have said sense that they do plan on adding a toggle to let you manual out of that macro mode. I hope it gets added soon.\n",

      "Processing: It should be a software update. can't wait for it because my CAMERAs are suffering.\n",
      "Finished processing transcript 19 - batch 23.7\n",
      "Processing: You know, there's still no astroCAMERAgraphy mode in the iphone, even though in night mode, you can sometimes see some stars if you hold the phone still for long enough. And there's no pro mode for manual control over CAMERAs or for CAMERAs, That's still going to require a third party app to really dig into that stuff.\n",
      "Finished processing transcript 19 - batch 23.8\n",
      "Processing: What they did add is cinematic CAMERA mode, which I talked about in the 13 review to summarize. It's a 1080p 30fps HDR CAMERA CAMERA mode and I really don't think it's the answer when it comes to taking the reins and making the best CAMERAs possible on your iphone at least not yet.\n",
      "Finished processing transcript 19 - batch 23.9\n",
      "Processing: I mean if you want to tailor a whole entire shoot around focus racking then yes the iphones will punch above their weight class but I found myself using the regular CAMERA mode or even third-party apps to get the best CAMERA out of the iphone still but you know it would actually help to get better CAMERA out of the iphone prores CAMERA giant asterisk that's not in the phones yet. So the pro iphones should also ideally in a software update be getting prores CAMERA for those unfamiliar.\n",

It's a pretty sweet should be awesome to be able to shoot Prores CAMERA from your phone mix it with other CAMERAs bring it into your editor and just start chopping that couple other small asterisks though one Prores CAMERA would be 4k.\n",

      "Processing: 30 on every pro iphone except the 128 gig base PHONE_PERFORMANCE versions those will max out at 1080p 30fps. It's unclear if this is because you'd just fill up the PHONE_PERFORMANCE too fast and they didn't want to let you you know there could be some merit to that 4k is big files it's like six gigs per minute You could theoretically fill up the whole phone in two hours if you just shot all day but also it could be because the slower PHONE_PERFORMANCE that's typically used in lower pricing lower tiered models of less PHONE_PERFORMANCE might not have supported it in the first place.\n",

      "Processing: It's a high data rate one or the other, maybe both. I don't know, But just know as long as if you're planning on getting a Pro iphone just to shoot 4k ProRes CAMERA, you'll have to get at least a 256gb version and you can actually go all the way up to one terabyte of total PHONE_PERFORMANCE.\n",

Uh, there are some new colors the space black which is my favorite in years and there's also a new purple color from certain angles you can hardly even tell it's purple but if it hits the light you know for a pro phone that's a solid purple I guess really only the CAMERA bumps change They are definitely slightly larger and thicker than the 13 pros But bottom line is when an iphone 13 pro can fit in an iphone 14 pro's case And you know it's pretty close in return Okay, so now we're really getting into the meat of what you really start to notice on these new phones iphone 14 pro and 14 pro max have some slightly updated 6-.1 inch and 6.7 inch oled displays respectively So there's still excellent displays on paper with slightly thinner SCREEN_OR_DISPLAYs that you won't notice and slightly higher CAMERA that you also won't notice And an even higher, brighter 2000 SCREEN_OR_DISPLAY peak brightness that you absolutely will notice when looking at the phone on like a bright sunny day.\n",

      "Processing: so you hit the power button, you sleep the phone, you put it down, the brightness drops the LTPO oled display goes all the way down to one hertz and you get to see the clock and notifications roll in as if your lock screen is still on just at a lower brightness. This is a pretty bright, always-on display, though You can see that right Like it.\n",

      "Processing: You get used to it after a few days, but I constantly was looking over at my phone on my desk, thinking it was still on, which is like a lower brightness. but yeah, it looks like that All the time, the transition from the home screen to the always on display is really nice.\n",
      "Finished processing transcript 20 - batch 21.9\n",
      "Processing: It's got this smooth fade animation. And I think that's the Apple way, like the clock, if it's behind something, will graduate to the front of the Oasan display and it maintains all the colors and skin tones and whatever wallpaper you were using.\n",

      "Finished processing transcript 20 - batch 23.6\n",

      "Finished processing transcript 20 - batch 23.7\n",
      "Processing: And that would just make more sense. But whatever the point is, it just works right off the rip matter of fact, here's everything that the dynamic island does right out the box on day one.\n",
      "Finished processing transcript 20 - batch 23.8\n",

      "Processing: But the thing is, it's going to be surprisingly hard to copy it exactly like this on this level, it seems pretty innocuous, pretty simple, but there is a lot going on here. Like there's a new display engine in the A16 bionic that handles all these animations.\n",

      "Processing: that's so great so a new larger 48 CAMERA CAMERA that's going to bend down to 12 CAMERAs for all your normal CAMERAs but you do get the benefits of sharpness and more light gathering from a larger CAMERA that also gives you faster CAMERA speeds to freeze motion more often in non-perfect conditions And it lets me take CAMERA CAMERAs with a shorter CAMERA time, which is very convenient. But the larger CAMERA also gives you a really nice shallow, natural depth of field without CAMERA mode, more than we've ever seen from an iphone CAMERA.\n",
      "Finished processing transcript 20 - batch 25.9\n",

      "Processing: But I've been very impressed with how well the iphone deals with, both not a whole ton of fringing on close-up subjects and 100 coverage with focus pixels has been pretty locked in on tracking subjects and keeping things in focus even with the shallow depth of field. My only complaint really is the pretty weak minimum focus distance things get blurred when you get close to the primary CAMERA.\n",
      "Finished processing transcript 20 - batch 26.1\n",
      "Processing: So you got to switch to the macro mode pretty early. Luckily, the ultra wide has some improvements too so that's not the end of the world Then a 48 CAMERA CAMERA also enables this new 2x button doesn't seem like that huge of a deal but it's literally just cropping in on the middle 12 CAMERAs of this huge CAMERA so it's essentially like an CAMERA CAMERA it's not like you're going to lose quality the way anything less than 3x would have been before on iphones because it was cropping into an already 12 CAMERA CAMERA.\n",
      "Finished processing transcript 20 - batch 26.2\n",
      "Processing: The 48 CAMERA CAMERA also enables this new action mode and CAMERA which is this super aggressive stabilization for really shaky CAMERA and it does this with a pretty heavy crop but it's also able to still shoot in up to 2.8 K in this mode. A little pro tip it defaults to the 0.5 X CAMERA it's much noisier when you do this so so I I do recommend switching back to the primary for it and then if you're running around chasing a subject or even pulling it out a car window or just anytime you need some pretty heavy stabilization this is definitely nice to have if you want the full 48 CAMERA files you can shoot in pro-raw and it will kick out 50 60 70 megabyte Dng files which have a lot of detail and latitude to push around in lightroom and make them look better than the straight out of CAMERA 12 CAMERA shots but I'll leave that to the Peter McKinnon's and Tyler Stalman's or many other CAMERAgraphy creators I know are going to put this to the test one thing they didn't do with the new 48 CAMERA CAMERA is 8k CAMERA they could have they've not been able to until they crossed the 30 CAMERA threshold they got to 48 they didn't do it that of course would also probably still be pretty tough considering the max iphone is still one terabyte which sounds like a lot but then you're also working with huge five six gig per minute Prores files that take forever to get off the iphone via this lightning port in the slow speeds and they should probably just switch to USBC and that's a whole rant for another day so I'll just stop it there but just know no AK CAMERA straight from the iphone's CAMERA I think I can honestly safely though put the iphone 14 pro as the best CAMERA system in any phone in 2022. don't get me wrong it's not perfect it can definitely over bake HDR sometimes in some harsh shooting conditions and the new selfie CAMERA which now has 12 CAMERAs and autofocus while it handles a variety of focal lengths much better and is sharper overall, it still has a tendency to overexpose people with dark skin constantly.\n",

And the one thing you definitely can argue for 60 hertz would be battery life, because despite all the issues floating around, the battery life on these phones has been pretty good.. so I don't know if you saw it, but Apple has officially now addressed the heat and battery issues that some people, including myself, have been reporting with these iphones.\n",

Sometimes I'm going to say it's a toss--up depending on the scenario and that's not a cop--out I gave my reasons um but if I could only pick one which is sort of a different question I would pick iphone 11 Pro because it's more versatile it has the ultra wide and it absolutely crushes it in CAMERA like CAMERA is just not as much of a focus with the pixel 4's CAMERA anymore no pun intended It tops out at 4k.\n",

Pro, my pixel versus iphone CAMERA graph is like this pair of lines where the middle is where most CAMERAs are taken most of the time and that's where I prefer pixel but on the edges of CAMERAgraphy like CAMERA or ultra wide then the iphone does better.\n",

It seems like it's wearing well it doesn't have any staining problems or anything like that except the power button is still glossy That's a little different from the rest of the body but yeah the result is this pretty clean and well--built design no seams I've seen some headlines of people getting pixels that weirdly have the back slightly detached like separated from the front BUILD_QUALITY piece here super odd but clearly mine doesn't have that issue at all it's water resistant which is awesome there's a classic fast reliable fingerprint reader back here that can double as a notification shade pull down if you're into that and then there's a cut out in the back for BATTERY_OR_CHARGING which is clever but overall pretty understated I would say the phone is small it's a six-inch edge-to-edge display but it's small it's smaller than the iphone 12 smaller than a lot of other flagships and I think a lot of people appreciate that and I don't know what it is about this green tech, all this green stuff coming out.\n",

So that's a pixel thing but the biggest new piece Google's adding to these phones is definitely on the inside And that would be the new tensor chip so designed by Google for this phone this is going to let them do in theory things that they couldn't do with the off--the--shelf qualcomm chip they'd used before you know machine learning better AI better computational CAMERAgraphy all kinds of things they want to focus on with just this phone they can do it and it's done that it's really impressive now a lot of people are wondering how tensor would benchmark just and I don't think that's the right way to think about this new chip but just out of curiosity I threw a geekbench at it and we have the numbers it got 1035 on single core 2800 multi-core so that's maybe 8 to 10 slower with the PHONE_PERFORMANCE on paper than the snapdragon triple eight but also still way way ahead of the snapdragon 765 G they used on the pixel five last year but then also I did uh, some gpu benchmarks from 3dmark and it was looking at 10 to 12 faster than the snapdragon triple a But that's clearly not what tensor is about this.\n",

You can see in a selfie viewfinder, especially it'll look super jacked up and really noisy just to keep a high frame rate and CAMERA speed when you're taking the selfie and then you take it and you see it process and then everything sharpens up and it looks miles better.\n",

      "Processing: And the preview might not look great, but at least it's not choppy and laggy and then it basically under promises and over-delivers People will see the viewfinder and think this will be a bad CAMERA. And then they'll be shocked at how good the final CAMERA is when you're taking CAMERAs with faces in them.\n",

      "Processing: I mean, that's, you kind of just never have blurry faces in your CAMERAs overall. Just as someone who's used now both of these phones for a couple weeks, iphone's CAMERA system is better than the pixels it just is right now it doesn't it's more consistent it doesn't struggle with over processing it shoots to more formats it's a better overall CAMERA system but this the hardware is so good in the pixels and you can see that promise in those 10 out of 10 shots that the pixel fan in me is like hoping maybe in one or two software updates it'll be a 10 out of 10 more often but until then because we don't know if that's ever gonna happen yeah you saw the sample shots that's that's what it does that's how it looks so yeah I want to come back to the price at the end here like I said 5.99 for pixel 6 8.99 for pixel 6 pro it's a 300 delta and for that difference you're getting 120 hertz over 90 1440p over 1080 a curved screen over a flat one some glossy sides over the matte sides.\n",

      "Processing: that's kind of it so basically my conclusion is pixel 6 really good phone really really great deal because for 600 bucks, this is one of the best ones you can get and then the difference in money to get to six Pro, it makes it a better phone than the pixel six Sure a lot of good stuff here but this stuff doesn't vault it over the top of all the other flagships it just you know I would get this phone if you've really got to have the teleCAMERA or the ultra wide selfie CAMERA or the bigger faster screen that's kind of the main bullets.

Finally dropping that massive Zenui skin and bringing it way back to near stock Android dropping all the bloatware, all the unnecessary duplicate apps and the ugly launcher and custom icons and themes and settings and things we didn't like this is much better, much cleaner and hopefully that spells faster software updates as well.\n",

Now, the main CAMERA here is actually the same one that was in the nothing phone and the roG phone 6, both of which took like B to B plus quality CAMERAs at best and were a noticeable step behind the flagships in pretty much every way.\n",

If anything, it can have the tendency to go over the top and really over process and over HDR things that looks kind of harsh, and you can really see that in higher dynamic range situations, But the extra stabilization does help not just for CAMERA, but also for taking less noisy CAMERAs in the dark, at least on the main CAMERA, it's still not freezing moving subjects very well because you need a fast CAMERA speed and a bigger CAMERA to do that.\n",

      "Processing: It's easily two days, but the other thing to think about with a fast charging system like this is you still want to think about battery health long term and that's also something ASUs is thinking about so they've built in a bunch of different battery charging adjustments to address that so there's now steady charging Which charges slower for better battery health there's scheduled charging so you can reduce the time that the battery is full and not in use So basically it slow charges overnight and then finishes up to 100 when it's time to get up And you can set that to finish charging Depending on when your scheduled alarm is that is dope And you can also manually set a charging upper limit to just straight up limit your max charge to 80 or 90 And then on top of that there's something called bypass mode Which is such, it's such a gamer specific thing But when you're in this mode you plug in the phone let's say you're gaming it bypasses charging the battery And just puts the power straight into the system so that you're not heating up the battery as you're charging because you're not charging and you're not cycling the battery So it's just going straight into the actual system. Who would have thought it's a great idea so I'm clearly very impressed with the battery as you can probably tell but there's more first of all they brought the headphone jack back is this the first phone that I've seen that's ditched the headphone jack with one year's upgrade and then brought it back the next year I think so I think so they moved it from the phone in the rog phone 3 to the fan accessory through USB last year now it's back in the phone and not only is the headphone jack back but there's a dac behind it and there's a whole audio wizard built into the software that lets you drag 10 different frequency response sliders and change the audio in a crazy way like that's just that's approaching too much customization at this point it's awesome they've also technically leveled up the performance and the specs of the phone here too.\n",

And I think the answer for a really small group of people is, yes, people that play a lot of well--optimized games on their phone and want the best possible experience for that, will enjoy this phone and things like air triggers and the faster SCREEN_OR_DISPLAY and the snappier response time of the display, and the gaming specific features like X-mode that throttles up the PHONE_PERFORMANCE and game genie, that lets you, you know, feature hub for stuff like recording the screen and silencing notifications and clearing out PHONE_PERFORMANCE for a little bit of extra performance, all that stuff for that tiny group of people?\n",

So the easiest place to start is the hardware and a lot of interesting decisions went into the hardware department for the Oneplus 2 But they all came together to equal a really nice phone That feels good in the hand and that's what's important So it has a nice little weight to it.\n",

That should translate to much better battery life and BATTERY_OR_CHARGING number 4 is this is also now a 128 gigabyte phone so double the PHONE_PERFORMANCE you had with one plus three was a 64 gigabyte phone tops so 100 when TA That should alleviate some of the concerns of people who really wanted expandable PHONE_PERFORMANCE.\n",

Obviously you're only going to care about this if you take a lot of selfies or front--facing CAMERA but for what it's worth I did notice a difference in the quality of the CAMERAs and the CAMERAs from the front--facing CAMERA It did seem to struggle a little bit with focus sometimes possibly since it's also an F 2.0 aperture but when you do now focus with this front--facing CAMERA you can tell the difference and the selfies look really good from the 1 + 3 t nice and wide-angle decent colors decent dynamic range again and better sharpness and even a slightly shallower depth of field when your subject is closed and finally number 6 last but not least is the software so you note out of the box the 3t is running Android marshmallow still but with their upgraded very light oxygen OS.\n",

      "Finished processing transcript 39 - batch 39.1\n",
      "Processing: Seriously, how are these not the same phone? plus they've kept a lot of the design cues from previous OnePLUS phones from the 3 and the 3T with, you know, the alert slider of course, and the ports on the bottom and USB type C. It's kind of like a Frankenstein smartphone design, pulling parts from a bunch of different places.\n",

      "Finished processing transcript 39 - batch 39.6\n",
      "Processing: Also the design is kind of limited because the only colors you can actually get this phone in are literally black and almost black which I love matte black. that's great But obviously if you want some variety you can grab a skin, I'll link to these below.\n",
      "Finished processing transcript 39 - batch 39.7\n",

Now the dual CAMERA system on the back before we even get to CAMERA quality is already pretty interesting First of all it's it's the headlining new feature.\n",

No pun intended but it is a 16 CAMERA F 1.7 primary CAMERA with electronic CAMERA stabilization and then a 20 CAMERA F 2.6 teleCAMERA CAMERA as a secondary on paper that looks pretty good And then when you open up the new CAMERA app you'll notice it is a blatant copy of the iphone CAMERA app no doubt about that the 1x to 2x button for switching between the CAMERAes is there settings in the strip on the left CAMERA button on the right it's pretty basic and then the slider of course between the 1x and the 2x when CAMERAing in it's definitely a copy here no one can really deny that here's the thing I've always said I don't really mind if you copy stuff but if you're going to copy something copy the good stuff so if you're going to copy the iphone one of the best and most popular phones out there then yeah sure copy the CAMERA copy the fingerprint reader don't copy the bad stuff don't copy like Siri or something Bixby so this one extra 2x button and the slider and everything in the CAMERA.\n",

      "Processing: Again I wish it had CAMERA CAMERA stabilization but essentially this CAMERA is a hit or miss experience. I've been taking CAMERAs with this CAMERA for more than a week now and in just like everyday scenarios and a lot of them turn out really nice.\n",
      "Finished processing transcript 39 - batch 40.4\n",

      "Finished processing transcript 39 - batch 40.5\n",
      "Processing: So you'd expect it to be great and detail is pretty much always on point the center of the frame and whatever's in focus is always sharp colors and CAMERA processing were pretty average. I feel like nothing was pushed too far in contrast or saturation except maybe the reds a little bit because sometimes they got oversaturated.\n",
      "Finished processing transcript 39 - batch 40.6\n",
      "Processing: But otherwise it's pretty subjective. whether you like the look of a CAMERA or not.\n",
      "Finished processing transcript 39 - batch 40.7\n",
      "Processing: I think objectively it'll score high on CAMERA benchmark tests because it's very fast, very sharp and has huge dynamic range but side by side with the same shot from pixel or an iphone. It could be a toss-up which is quite good for a phone at this price.\n",
      "Finished processing transcript 39 - batch 40.8\n",
      "Processing: And then there's the CAMERA mode from the secondary teleCAMERA CAMERA. honestly.\n",
      "Finished processing transcript 39 - batch 40.9\n",
      "Processing: Overall, this wasn't any better than the same attempts from the iphone 7 plus, but also not worse kind of struggles with complex edges but for the most part it does a good job blurring backgrounds. Obviously it does a much better job on humans than it does on less predictable, less CAMERAy subjects and it still has some weird halo effects near the edges but just overall it doesn't quite match having a naturally shallow depth of field obviously.\n",
      "Finished processing transcript 39 - batch 41.0\n",
      "Processing: So if you're into it you can use it I think it'll get better with time with software updates like apples has you know apples was awful when it first came out and was in beta but it's learned and it's gotten better over time with CAMERAs and I think this one will too but right now it's right in line with what we've already seen. so nothing super new here.\n",
      "Finished processing transcript 39 - batch 41.1\n",
      "Processing: Also you might be wondering why the secondary teleCAMERA CAMERA with the worst aperture gets the 20 CAMERA CAMERA while the primary gets the 16 CAMERA but their logic for that is pretty simple. It's that when you're doing all that CAMERAing and you go way CAMERAed in you're using all the data from the teleCAMERA CAMERA so you want it to be a higher CAMERA so makes sense so beyond the design and the CAMERA and the specs a couple more minor things are new and a lot of the rest is the same stuff we've seen from previous onePLus phones it's great stuff but it's the same stuff so battery here is 3.\n",
      "Finished processing transcript 39 - batch 41.2\n",
      "Processing: 300 milliamp hours so not bigger it's actually 100 milliamp hours smaller than the 3t but the battery life is about the same it lasts comfortably all day thanks to the chip and the display and that display that 1080p amoled display this is probably the thing that's going to get looked at as the biggest downside of a phone when you compare it to the more expensive flagships But those are all the phones that enthusiasts are also considering buying so you kind of have to note those all have 1440P displays or higher so it's really easy to say, oh this is 1080p it must be awful, but I'd always challenge those people to really look at the display and tell if it really does look that much worse. I mean when I first got it first took it out the box, when it was brand new, didn't even look at the spec sheet and tried to just look at it and tell if I could see if it's a 1080p display or did they finally move to 1440p and it took me more than just a glance so it's a pretty good display.\n",
      "Finished processing transcript 39 - batch 41.3\n",
      "Processing: It gets bright enough, has pitch black blacks from being an amoled etc. It's good And then of course that 1080p display also means performance is a plus a snapdragon 835 with the Adreno 540 and 8 gigs of PHONE_PERFORMANCE Of course all pushing near stock android on a 1080p display It better not hiccup this thing flies through Android and that's its biggest asset.\n",

      "Processing: [music] Hey, what is up guys mkBHP here and well welcome back to Techtober the event that we are waiting for just wrapped up which means i'm not allowed to share that my daily driver for the past couple days has been the brand new Oneplus 6t so this phone's had a lot of hype leading up to it We started seeing those specs and a little bit of design leaks and basically got a lot of people waiting for this phone so the Oneplus 6t is in the purest sense of the word an incremental update. Most of it is the same as the Oneplus 6 that we're already familiar with that I liked a lot and then you could consider this a bit of a design refresh a couple months later So they took the Oneplus 6 which is already a pretty solid and well--liked phone and they made some upgrades and some tweaks to things that they felt could be better And they took it up a notch okay there's your notch pun for the CAMERA so there are conveniently six new things with the oneplus 6t so first of all the new display it's bigger it's a 6.4 inch display and still your 2340x1080 optic amoled they've been on for a while and it's still pretty great it's bright it's colorful and has a built--in adjustable color profiles obviously I'm a big phone person and phone screens keep getting bigger and I still love it also slightly smaller chin than the Oneplus 6 not drastically smaller but you can see it when you put them side by side so the display is definitely an improvement and that brings us to number two as you can see the teardrop notch up here at the top Everything oneplus wanted to do with the fairly standard notch on the Oneplus 6 they are still doing in the smaller notch on this 6t except for the notification led so up here is the front-facing CAMERA the earpiece and the proximity and ambient light CAMERAs no fancy face ID dot projector or depth CAMERAs or anything like that.\n",

      "Processing: And for a lot of people, including me, this is an improvement, larger screen, closer to the SCREEN_OR_DISPLAYs and more room up top for notifications and info, But you can still hide the notch with software. if you want to.\n",
      "Finished processing transcript 40 - batch 40.4\n",

      "Finished processing transcript 40 - batch 40.5\n",
      "Processing: If you remember the essential phone that notch had, probably about the same volume and total size, but it was pretty rectangular on the sides. This one is all slopey and then it just, it just touches the top of whatever app you're using in the middle.\n",
      "Finished processing transcript 40 - batch 40.6\n",

      "Processing: Again, a lot of people were looking forward to happy to see this slowly starting to become more common in mainstream phones.

      "Finished processing transcript 40 - batch 40.8\n",
      "Processing: I've left it enabled the entire time I've been using it and I'd say it's, it's faster than that first gen from the vivo phone. I first tested a couple months ago, but uh, still slower than the gold standard of like touch id or a lot of the physical fingerprint readers it's just somewhere in between it's not instant but it's just a little beat of you unlocking your phone it's it's getting there you can't really just touch your finger to the screen and then remove it quickly and get to using the phone it'll still tell you you're going too fast but if you leave it there for a beat you're in pretty quick the animation is pretty corny i think and there's two others you can pick from in the software but the thing is they all happen at full brightness that's part of how the tech of this CAMERA fingerprint reader underneath the screen works it involves shining a light on your fingerprint so even though it's an oled and they can keep all the pixels black and the clock is dim to save battery.\n",
      "Finished processing transcript 40 - batch 40.9\n",

      "Processing: [music] hey what's up guys MKBHD here and this is the oneplus 7t so if you follow the leaks aka promo you've probably seen pretty much every angle of this thing but now it's officially been unveiled i've been using it daily for about a week and this is a pretty easy phone to explain so oneplus the company they have their sort of upper mid--range phones somewhere around 500 600 like onePLus 7 then they have their premium high--end flagship stuff like oneplus 7 pro that's closer to seven eight hundred bucks so this phone the oneplus 7t kind of kind of a hard name to say out loud it's not the 70 but it's the oneplus 7t this phone is sort of a frankenstein between those two groups it's right between the super high end and the upper mid-range if that makes any sense so to be perfectly clear it is a really great phone for the price which is basically the one plus special at this point they've continued this fascinating slow creep up in price but when you go over this phone and everything they've combined in here it's pretty on point for what you're getting for 599 bucks so this display is a perfect example right so just look at this screen the whole phone is really big as you can tell but that's because it's got this huge 6.55 inch oled screen. it's just barely smaller than the 7 Pro actually and that's a huge phone but you have the teardrop notch at the top from the 7 and it's a flat screen now instead of one of those panels that curves around the edges and I'm down with that and it is 90 hertz.\n",
      "Finished processing transcript 41 - batch 41.1\n",
      "Processing: so this is as far as I know I guess the cheapest phone with a high SCREEN_OR_DISPLAY display like this and I'm glad they brought that down. that's becoming a signature characteristic of these phones so overall it's a nice combination of things despite not being the highest end display you know it gets pretty bright up to a thousand SCREEN_OR_DISPLAY so outdoor visibility is no problem and the teardrop notch being a little smaller makes it super easy to ignore on this gigantic screen but it's also 1080p not 1440 and the SCREEN_OR_DISPLAYs are just a little bit thicker a tiny bit as you can see and I have noticed some real off--axis color tint and rainbowing and other consistencies like that that you'll notice on not so high--end oled displays so it's not the super best of the best but it's like right underneath it's right in between it's making sense right they're bringing things down from the higher end phone that makes sense while keeping the sort of baseline of the mid--range the higher fresh rate I think is the most important thing that they brought down that I just I love me some 90 hertz some high SCREEN_OR_DISPLAY goodness so that's good to see And then just the design of this phone in general is also a bit of a Frankenstein.\n",
      "Finished processing transcript 41 - batch 41.2\n",
      "Processing: you've probably noticed it by now. There's this aura blue color again although this time it's not as matte as before it's kind of closer to like a satin because it has more of a sheen to it.\n",
      "Finished processing transcript 41 - batch 41.3\n",
      "Processing: It's not really glossy like some other phones but you definitely do still see fingerprints much more than a matte phone So it's somewhere in between again the 7 Pro is more matte than this one But here's some other improvements. you do have the alert slider is tighter so it's more satisfying to move between the three positions So that's pretty sweet.\n",
      "Finished processing transcript 41 - batch 41.4\n",
      "Processing: They brought down the high--end really precise haptic motor that's honestly only really matched on Android by the pixel at this point. So that was great and they brought the CAMERA fingerprint reader underneath the BUILD_QUALITY that's also the same CAMERA as the one from the seven Pro and I think one of the best in any phone under the BUILD_QUALITY right now the BUILD_QUALITYs are also just as good as the 7 Pro They sound loud and full and there's also a bigger BUILD_QUALITY grow up at the top and charging is now even faster, so they're calling it warp charge 30t it's still a 30-watt BATTERY_OR_CHARGINGr But thanks to improved battery chemistry in the 3.\n",
      "Finished processing transcript 41 - batch 41.5\n",
      "Processing: 800 milliamp hour battery in this phone it'll charge 23 faster than warp charge 30 already did so in other words it's silly fast and it's kind of a you know a different philosophy on battery management on one hand I love you know the little chunkier phones that'll have this massive battery inside an all--day battery life it changes the way I use phones. I didn't worry about charging ever during the day but on the other hand, a phone that's really trim like this that has crazy fast charging just lets you have this peace of mind that anytime you're starting to get low you can just plug in for a couple minutes and be right back up to 70 80 percent.\n",
      "Finished processing transcript 41 - batch 41.6\n",

      "Finished processing transcript 41 - batch 41.7\n",
      "Processing: It would be great to have both. but uh, as of right now I like having this warp charge 30t they say will get you to 70 from dead in half an hour And that's awesome and I believe that But I'm even more impressed by just how much you can add from plugging in for five minutes, 10 minutes and just giving you a massive boost for the rest of the day.\n",
      "Finished processing transcript 41 - batch 41.8\n",
      "Processing: So the 7t does have decent battery life, but this is the steady compromise they make for not having the best battery life. And then of course, the gigantic CAMERA circle on the back.\n",
      "Finished processing transcript 41 - batch 41.9\n",
      "Processing: Uh, it's genuinely, I think the first design from OnePLus that doesn't feel to me like really sleek or clean, like they've done triple CAMERAs before, even but this one is very different. It kind of reminds me of somewhere between Motorola or the red Hydrogen or you might even remember the Nokia Lumia series back in the day.\n",
      "Finished processing transcript 41 - batch 42.0\n",
      "Processing: Funny thing is these are essentially the same exact CAMERAs that the OnePLUs 7 Pro already has same standard 48 CAMERA standard CAMERA, same 117 degree ultra wide, and then a shorter 2x teleCAMERA CAMERA CAMERA instead of a 3x. So if you're actually looking for some big CAMERA improvements for the 7T that is not what's happening here Uh and it's actually not like the Oneplus 7 Pro CAMERA was bad.\n",
      "Finished processing transcript 41 - batch 42.1\n",
      "Processing: it's just that it was the one part of the phone that wasn't you know, best in class world class. It sort of held it back from being an arguably perfect phone in a way but in a 600 phone in 2019, this set of CAMERAs is perfectly good.\n",
      "Finished processing transcript 41 - batch 42.2\n",
      "Processing: I've been taking CAMERAs and CAMERAs with it just to see if I notice any substantial differences around but uh, there isn't anything too drastic still very solid in daylight and a bit color fringy and soft around the edges with close--up subjects and passable but not amazing shots in less than ideal lighting if you think about other CAMERAs in this 600 price range that's about right actually uh, right up until they start to get blown out the water by the seven hundred dollar iphone 11. you can take CAMERA mode shots now in teleCAMERA or standard CAMERAs now, which is cool And they are also enabling 4k 30fps CAMERA from the ultrawide CAMERA So they've heard our feedback. They are going to do that And I think the most impressive improvement here is the new super macro mode So you hit this little flower icon in the top corner and you can get way up close to things uh 2.5 to 8 centimeters away from the CAMERA CAMERA which most smartphones do struggle with if they don't have a macro mode And so with this I was able to take some close--ups that I couldn't even get with the iphone 11 and then of course, this wouldn't be a new oneplus phone without really killer high--end on--paper specs And so that's what they've done here again, so snapdragon e55 plus the newest chip eight gigs of PHONE_PERFORMANCE not 12 and 128 or 256 gigs of UFS 3.0 PHONE_PERFORMANCE so yeah this thing is fast and it's running the latest version of Oxygen OS 10 on top of Android 10 which I think makes this the first non-pixel Android 10 phone I've used and it's been really good so far I obviously love that they're early to updates and performance has actually been really smooth you may have noticed I didn't keep the Android 10 gestures the swipe gestures turned on here's why Android 10 gestures on this phone are a swipe up from the bottom for home a half swipe up for PHONE_PERFORMANCE and then a swipe in from the lower side to go back from anywhere you know what else uses that swipe to go back on the side a lot of Android apps for other things, Twitter to switch between accounts.\n",

      "Finished processing transcript 41 - batch 42.6\n",
      "Processing: So all that, for me, using this phone has added up to it being a pretty solid set of trade--offs that add up to a pretty good phone for pretty great price It really feels like they're taking the stuff that they learned how to do better and more efficiently from the 7 Pro and bringing it down to a more competitive price, which is a great way to sell a lot of phones. Now of course, to be perfectly clear, the OnePLus 7 Pro is still a better phone than this Just because of the small bit of trade-offs, they've kept a higher quality display, higher CAMERA, not as much color fringing and things like that, uh, bigger battery, uh, less ugly CAMERA bump on the back and the notchless screen on the front.\n",
      "Finished processing transcript 41 - batch 42.7\n",
      "Processing: So all that sort of adds up to a little bit of trade-offs here. But overall, this is that incremental update you expect from a T-phone from OnePLus with the X factor of that 90HZ display that is so hard to switch back from.\n",

This is basically combining the best of both worlds So from a low battery you can add about 60 charge in 15 minutes Which on such a big battery can last you an entire new day And even if you don't have a heavy day of use, You know, I haven't really used this phone for very long But you can already tell this bigger battery combined with the LTPO2 display is going to reward lighter usage days with a much longer BATTERY_OR_CHARGING.\n",

So, I gotta withhold any of my official review type judgment until then, like if it ends up being seven, eight, nine hundred dollars, which is probably about where it'll land.\n",

The 10T is literally the worst phone that came out last year.\n",

Sure but the point is they're sort of reflecting shades of old OnePLus which is a really good thing because this phone is really good So this is a flagship smartphone right now for 6.99 in a world where the galaxy S23 just came out, it's 7.99 that's a sort of a de facto default for a lot of people.\n",
      "Finished processing transcript 45 - batch 45.5\n",
      "Processing: My semi--hot take is, this could be a better phone for a lot of people Now it's not perfect, and they still do some classic corner cutting things to pull this off and there are still some software behaviors that I really do not like, but here are the basics so if you want just a classic spec sheet bang for the buck summary. This phone has a snapdragon 8 gen 2 with 8 gigs of PHONE_PERFORMANCE, a 6.7 inch 1440p 120 Hertz oled display triple CAMERAs and a 5, 000 milliamp hour battery with 80 watt charging for 699 bucks.\n",
      "Finished processing transcript 45 - batch 45.6\n",
      "Processing: that's pretty damn good So I think because the phone has like the nice screen, the big battery and the newest chip it begs comparisons to like the 900, 000 other flagship phones but like I said it does cut some corners the big one being no BATTERY_OR_CHARGING huge and then the other it's IP64 rated instead of IP67 so it'll survive a mist better than a splash but on the design front I'd call this a mixed bag mixed bag. You know, it definitely is taking a step away from the ultra generic last generation.\n",

      "Processing: Not quite sandstone level, but enough to be interesting. So I like it and the CAMERA bump the CAMERA bump is kind of a weird hybrid of smoothly wrapping around the side like Samsung used to but then turning it into a big circle plateau that looks like a generic, not seamless thing anymore at all.\n",

      "Processing: It was rare but I could plug in for a few minutes and have more than enough it is that OPPO Supervook charging tech so it's still the brick with USB A instead of USBC but hey at least it comes in the box plus the cable so I know also having BATTERY_OR_CHARGING would be really convenient and it's kind of annoying going from a phone that does have BATTERY_OR_CHARGING to one that doesn't but I think OnePLUS is counting on people who have other phones now that don't have BATTERY_OR_CHARGING, moving to this one and finding it's like an awesome battery experience so that's what they're counting on But let me talk about the CAMERAs in this phone because these are also a throwback to old OnePLUS which if you remember those phones means not as good as the flagships but really solid. So it's got that 50 CAMERA main CAMERA that bins down to 12 and a half CAMERAs and it gives me CAMERAs that are generally pretty sharp and nice if you don't CAMERA in.\n",
